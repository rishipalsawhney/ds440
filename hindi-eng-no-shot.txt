Is there a black box in your car?
While American road planners struggle to find cash to fix a crumbling highway system.
Those devices that keep track of each mile driven by the motor driver and provide that information to the authorities.
Generally, the area of the monotonous highway plan has suddenly started giving birth to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have supported joining with environmental groups to lobby the government, so that it can be left.
The tea party is surprised.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and is raising various privacy issues.
And while Congress is unable to agree on whether to move forward or not, many states are not waiting.
They are trying to figure out how, in the next decade, they can transition to a system where drivers are
Thousands of motorists have already taken a test drive of the black box, some of which include GPS monitoring.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not something that we can choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, the Southern California Association.
How we pay for these tasks is going to change.
The technology exists to do so.
The shock comes when the country's Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the tax paid by Americans at the gas pump, is depleted.
Americans do not buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, at 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
When gas prices are high, politicians loathe to increase taxes, even if it's just a penny.
"The gas tax is absolutely not sustainable," said Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices on 500 cars to test the pay-per-mile system.
"It works as the most logical option for a long time," he said.
Wanks calls this a mileage-based user fee.
It is no surprise that this idea appeals to urban liberals, as it is related to driving patterns.
California's planners aim for the ambitious goals outlined in the state's global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he too considers it to be the most practical.
The Reason Foundation is also keen on paying drivers per mile in the free market.
"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy, who is in Reason.
People are buying those things for which they are paying directly.
This movement has also been strengthened by two former US Transportation Secretaries, who in a 2011 report...
The American Senate approved a pilot project worth 90 million dollars last year, which involved approximately 10,000 cars.
But the House leadership terminated the proposal, addressing the concerns of legislators from rural areas, who
Still, many states and cities are progressing on their own.
Oregon is the most enthusiastic, recruiting 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
The drivers will soon pay mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is conducting an investigation.
Illinois is testing this on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 collision, which affected 17 states on the East Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida)
This concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where equipment was installed in the cars of about 50 volunteers some time ago, drivers are aware of this fact.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major issue," said the strategist in the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This was not something that people wanted.
As soon as this test started, Nevada's ACLU issued a warning on its website: "These devices are completely tra
An indispensable tool that is widely used to keep a record of individuals' daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the many states now trying to find affordable technical equipment that can help the state.
"If you can do that," Khan said, "it becomes easier for the public."
The discovery of that technology has led some state agencies to a small startup company in California, True Mileage.
This company was not primarily in the business of helping states, but to impose tax on drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers insure based on their mileage.
But the devices being tested by him attract highway planners because they do not use GPS.
"If you don't track their speed and location, people will be more eager to do it," said Tru Mai.
There have been some major mistakes in these state pilot programs.
There are less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are running a laboratory to give drivers various options.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they cannot select a device, instead they are run by the average M operated by all state residents.
Other places are hoping to sell this concept to a vigilant public that devices should do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation authorities have sought to develop a device that imposes a tax, which is for parking.
"Motorists will be attracted to participate due to the significance of the benefits they will receive through this," said an urban planner.
However, some transportation planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is just a big joke.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area have said that Congress is very much
An additional one-time or annual tax may be imposed on hybrid vehicles and their drivers.
"When you only need to take an aspirin, there is no need for major surgery,"
If we do this, millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death was due to drowning.
However, the police have taken the deceased's friend into custody because he had hidden the deceased's belongings at his house.
The police have submitted the final investigation report to the court.
It can be recalled that on August 26, the police recovered the body of Jahid Iqbal from the Jhelum River in Padshahi Park.
His family had accused his friends because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
The police said in their report that the deceased's phone and SIM card were checked and his phone was named after a woman named Saura.
After questioning the woman, she said that the phone was given to her by a relative named Ruhel Gauhar.
Ruhel also lived in the Imperial Park and he was a friend of the deceased.
On August 25, after the Jumma prayers, Ruhel decided to go with Jahid to bathe in the Jhelum River.
Jahid took off his clothes and left everything on the shore, while Ruhel went to the other shore and smoked a cigar.
When he returned, Jahid was not there, only his clothes were there.
Ruhel searched for Jahid, but he couldn't find him.
Then he picked up his mobile phone, watch, and other items and kept them for his use.
He didn't tell anyone that Jahid has drowned.
The police informed the court that Jahid has drowned and the post-mortem report has confirmed it.
However, Ruhel was arrested under section 404 for concealing the facts and property of the deceased.

77-year-old former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, who is known for his Bunga Bunga parties.
This revelation was made by a family friend, Marithel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been the Prime Minister three times, married former TV anchor Francesca in his private church.
Francesca had met Berlusconi when she was a teenage activist of the Forza Italia party.
This is the same Francesca about whom it has been said that her relationship with Berlusconi is false.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga Bunga girl Marithel Polanco revealed that she was also part of this secret.
This ceremony took place three weeks ago.
During an appearance on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if they both got married.
This was not a public event.
This wedding was organized in the church of the former Prime Minister's house.
Besides this, nothing else can be said.
Still, she did not go to the wedding.
She had sent her best wishes for the newlywed couple.
They got married around three weeks ago, on 8th or 9th October.
He got engaged to a 28-year-old woman, Fransiska Pascal, about 8 months ago, who is 50 years younger than him.
To avoid embarrassment, Berlusconi attributed his decision to marry to loneliness.

Asaram, imprisoned on charges of sexual harassment, faced disappointment once again from the Supreme Court on Friday.
On behalf of Asaram, it was argued that the media coverage portrayed him as a Dracula who drinks the blood of children.
The panel led by Chief Justice P. Sathasivam has refused to impose a ban on media coverage about Asaram.
How can we stop them when they are gathering information from the police and other people?
Before that, Asaram's lawyers accused the media of showing extremely biased news.
There are many newspapers and news channels in the country.
They cannot file a lawsuit against each one of them, but the panel was not influenced by this argument and the complaint was registered.
The court had already rejected the request to impose a ban on media coverage of Asaram.
The department officials claim that this is the biggest case of TDS theft so far.
The director of the Mall Group paid all financial institutions after deducting TDS, but he paid to the government treasury.
In this way, they managed the accumulated TDS amount.
The team from Mumbai Income Tax Department, along with the team from Jaipur Income Tax Department, conducted a raid on this group on October 17.
During the investigation of this group, it was revealed that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
That's why the TDS team started the income tax survey of this group.
Approximately 15 days ago, a raid and survey was conducted on the board of directors of the mall, before the accounts were sealed.
Upset with these actions, the businessman clearly told the officials of the Income Tax Department that he is currently with the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department continues to target and take action against it.
In this matter, the authorities have explained that if the payment is not made, the accounts will be frozen and recovered.
The time for Diwali is approaching, hence the demand for sweets has increased.
As a result, there has been an increase in the sale of solid substances of adulterated and counterfeit milk.
Harmful chemicals are being used to make sweets shiny, colorful, and sweet, which is detrimental to health.
The Food and Drug Administration Department has launched a campaign against fake solid milk and chemically based sweets.
The department brought solid dairy products worth 70 thousand rupees from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand rupees from Quetta Colony.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for solidified fake milk from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received a notification that solid items of poor quality milk being brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur have been lost.
Solid substances of milk were transported from the garage to Nagpur.
The department had received information that the value of the seized solid milk products was 70 thousand rupees.
No one has claimed the solids of milk due to the risk of legal action.
The department has destroyed it because it was considered hostile (unknown).
The department raided Jitendra Caterers in Quetta Colony and seized around 5 thousand rupees in cash.
A chemical substance called Sodium Hydro-Sulfate is used to make chewing gum shiny and more durable.
A sample has been sent to the laboratory.
The Joint Commissioner of the department, S.S. Deshmukh, said that chemically based sweets and substandard or fake milk.
The department also said that this campaign will intensify in the next few days.
Consumption of these sweets can cause toxicity.
The department has requested the artisans to use good quality milk and solid milk products while making sweets.
The department has appealed to the public to be cautious of counterfeit sweets.
42 select senior leaders of the state's BJP unit gave him a grand welcome at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi was here on a condolence tour organized by BJP in Bihar.
The consolation journey was an exercise that the BJP undertook to console the families of the victims of the Patna bomb blast.
It is noteworthy that during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally on October 27, a total of 7 bombs exploded one after the other.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the bomb blasts was to create chaos during the rally.
The terrorists' intentions were thwarted, but six people died in the explosion.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
A procession was organized from their village by party leaders on Thursday.
Their last rites were performed in the Ganges in Patna on November 5.
This tour was part of the consolation tour.
The main player in this was Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of the people who died in the bomb explosion so that they can meet their families.
During this meeting and journey, he will donate a check of five lakh rupees to each bereaved family.
This financial aid has already been announced by the BJP.
When the thrilling Indian team played against Australia at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium after their unique victory.
The rain had washed out the last two one-day matches, they will have to win the Nagpur one-day match so that India can win the series.
In this series, Team India has achieved a target of 350 or more runs twice and once again saved the team.
Indian batting is now at its peak and even big targets seem small to them.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team's Yuvraj.
In the case of opening, the opening pair of Rohit and Shikhar is making the job easier for other batsmen.
They asked Virat to bat in Jaipur and Nagpur without any pressure, along with his unique opening partnership.
Virat has performed brilliantly at number 3 so far, hence he is seen as the future Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many great cricket players have said that they are better than Sachin.
Virat, who is turning 25 next week, has scored 17 one-day centuries, 16 of which have led to India's victory.
While pursuing the target, their average is more than 80 and they have emerged as an excellent finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in very good form, but over-reliance on these three could be detrimental for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were a big flop in the last match.
Yuvraj couldn't even open his account in the two matches of the series.
Because of this, a good inning in the Bengaluru one-day will be a 'lifeline' for him.
As far as the Australian team is concerned, their batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, impressed everyone with their performance.
There has been a demand to include him in the home Ashes Test team against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner performed well in the series.
Although Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch couldn't make an impact at the opening.
However, the absence of bowler Michael Johnson could pose problems.
Johnson, who had been performing well in the series so far, was sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
The national executive member and chief spokesperson of BJP, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is now becoming a threat to peace.
Citing the report of secret agencies, Singh said in a statement issued on Thursday that Pakistan is its own.

After the failure of separatist intentions to provoke people and spread widespread unrest in Kashmir, Pakistan
The BJP leader, referring to the separatist's tour of Pakistan, said that the ISI chief, Lieutenant General.
Pakistan is making a serious effort to fulfill this promise.
The killing of soldiers at the border and the suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of the same strategy.
Saying that it would be dangerous to demand the suspension of the army's special powers under these circumstances, he said.
This will assist international elements.
They emphasized that leaders should stop making statements that undermine the morale of the army and security forces.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in the case of American surveillance.
American whistleblower Edward Snowden has announced that if the American National Security Agency
German parliamentarian Hans-Christian Stroebel met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum.
A letter from Mr. Snowden was handed over to the media by a parliamentarian in Berlin on Friday, in which he
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes the support of the international community will force the American government to reconsider their stance.
The charges imposed by the American Justice Department include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden wants to meet with German officials.
After the claims of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone bugging by NSA, relations between the US and Germany have been strained.
Thomas Opperman, who is the head of the parliamentary panel that oversees the intelligence department, said that if Mr. S
Mr. Strobela, a member of parliament from Germany's Green Party, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He went on his Russia trip with two German journalists.
Mr. Strobele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, if Mr. Snowden left from there, he would go to Russia.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would need to ensure that he is "safe" there.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had endured a "severe and constant" torment that forced him away from his home.
Still, they said that the global response to "my political expression work" has encouraged them.
Citizens and high officials from around the world - including the United States - have acknowledged the widespread presence of an unknown system.
The letter has proposed to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for carry-on baggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carry-on luggage in their flight.
Frontier Airlines has charged passengers $100 for carry-on bags and $2 for coffee or soda.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier has said that if the fee is paid in advance, it will charge $25, if the passenger pays at the gate.
Border spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is for passengers to arrange the fee in advance.
"We are not to charge him," he said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Travelers trying to avoid those fees are filling their carry-on luggage in overhead bins, which means
One way is to take less luggage from the fee-paying passengers.
O'Malley said that the new allegation is not really about raising money.
This is about clarifying by Frontier's most loyal customers that searching for overhead bin space is slow.
Passengers buying tickets on the airline company's website will not need to make a payment.
This means that a passenger in line at the frontier gate may be allowed to carry one bag for free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to facilitate passengers' access to the gate.
The new carry-on fee for Frontier will not start until summer, although no date has been set.
Travelers often complain about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the increase in baggage fees as a sign that airlines are recovering after years of losses.
Still, most have not tried to touch the carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. initiated the carry-on fee for the first time three years ago, and later the associated discount.
"The only other airline with such a fee is Wizz Air of Hungary," said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is an expert.
They estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fees earn $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and thought that they were at the gate.
"The boarding process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see a tooth and nail fight at the gate.
The airplane was completely full, he said, "And it took off in a snap."
Frontier is also following Spirit's practice of charging 2 dollars for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who drink soda or juice can keep the whole can, and this includes free refills of coffee.
It will still give water.
In 2008, US Airways attempted to charge for short beverages, but stopped seven months later due to passenger complaints.
Frontier's decision to charge passengers for carry-on if they do not purchase directly from the airline.
Airlines give online travel sellers like Orbitz 10 to 25 dollars for each ticket sale.
This has encouraged all airlines to directly motivate passengers to purchase from them.
Frontier has made the most progress in this field.
In September, he started giving half the usual frequent flyer miles to those customers who went online.
On Wednesday, it reduced the travel miles award by 25 percent.
Thus, a 1,000-mile journey purchased from an online travel agency can earn 250 miles.
This allows passengers to select their seat in advance only when they directly access the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown Denver, but its business is shrinking.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent and its flight capacity shrank by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, which is a significant contraction.
As part of selling Republic Airlines, it is trying to fix Frontier's financial situation.
The NSA blamed an "internal error" for its website crash, not hackers.
The National Security Agency said late Friday night that its public website was down for a few hours.
"NSA.gov is not accessible tonight for several hours due to an internal error during a scheduled update."
The problem will be solved this evening.
Claims that the outage was due to a Distributed Denial of Service [DDoS] attack are not true.
Online server trackers noted this evening that the NSA's website was down for at least six hours, and some users
Earlier, the NSA spokesperson had told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network is "absolutely
The speaker said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are shutting down the NSA site with a DDOS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed in such a way that they flood the target website with traffic until the server overloads.
Cyber technology is relatively immature and is not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly highly secretive NSA, once referred to as the 'No Such Agency', has now become publicly exposed.
The growing controversy around the agency has initially speculated that tonight's incident is a targeted cyber attack.
An amazing performance was given in the show "One More Dronacharya", which bridged the gap between the Dwapar era and today's time.

Bombardier's profit decreased, there was a decline in aircraft supply and orders.
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday.
Bombardier, located in Montreal, has not released any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft.
About a month and a half after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has only flown three more times.
The results fell short of estimates and there was a decline of more than 8 percent in shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday upgraded his rating to "outperform".
"Although the majority of weak aircraft distribution was estimated, we clearly did not benefit from the margin performance in transportation."
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we doubt that the market program will.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will give it a share of the market so far controlled by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and took its first flight in September after months of delay.
But so far, there are only 177 firm orders for the CSeries, as potential buyers are considering the fuel efficiency of the new jetliner.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin had assured that Bombardier would meet its target of 300 steady orders.
The authorities assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not decide to stay on the ground longer than expected," Bodein said at a conference.
Every manufacturer schedules it in different ways.
We had decided that we would take the first flight and do an updated period, and that's what we have done.
This will happen during the entire flight program.
The company said that the second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest.
Still, analysts believe that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said that it is evaluating the Entry Into Service (EIS) schedule and will make an announcement in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although we have been informed according to Bombardier's internal schedule - is our concern."
In the third quarter ending on September 30, Bombardier's net profit was 147 million dollars, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The revenue fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts, as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the earnings per share is 10 cents and the income is 4.56 billion dollars.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, which is less than last year.
The net order decreased from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion until September 30, which was unchanged from December 31.
"In aerospace, the results were according to our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market situation were disappointing."
Aerospace revenue fell by 13 percent to 2 billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturing company, said that revenue in that department has fallen by nearly 11 percent.
The remaining work of orders in the transportation unit was 32.6 billion dollars until September 30, which was slightly less compared to December 31.
The implementation issues affected some major contracts on the margin of the transport department.
Officials said that new directions will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, who also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, is on the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's biggest competitor.
New research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
We do not entertain thoughts of lying, stealing, or deceiving anyone in our minds.
But as soon as evening comes, our thoughts change and we set aside our principles.
In a research conducted by Harvard University and David Eccles School of Business in Utah,
According to researchers, when we are not under work pressure in the morning, we give importance to moral values.
To test this, researchers conducted two experiments.
They asked to count the number of dots on the computer screen from some topics.
For example, the subjects had to say whether the points were more towards the right or left hand side.
After that, the participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the correct one, they will be given money.
This experiment shows that those who participated in the experiment between 8 am and 12 pm, made no mistakes.
Those who participated in the experiment between 12 noon and 6 pm, they tested their morality to an extent.
Researchers have successfully proven that the lure of money in the morning does not affect our honesty.
The research has been published in the current issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the robbers left the place, waving their pistols.
Relatives admitted the injured person to the hospital in a serious condition.
Sundar Sohanveer's son, a resident of Madhi village, has recently retired from the position of Junior Engineer in the Electricity Department.
On Wednesday, he was returning home on his bicycle after withdrawing 44 thousand rupees from the Bhola branch of Syndicate Bank.

When Sundar protested, they shot him in the stomach, causing him to get injured.
Upon hearing the news, family members and villagers took him to a hospital in Meerut in a serious condition.
No report had been submitted until the news report was made.
Note that three days ago, Jasveer, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot by two robbers while returning home from the same bank.

The cocaine-addicted lawyer who informed Mr. Big about the police investigation, was sent to jail.
Basharat Ditta, 42, used to provide information to the criminal leader, Neil Scarboro.
The lawyer was scared that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
A three-year prison sentence was announced in Liverpool Crown Court.
A prominent defense lawyer, who informed a drug lord about a major police investigation, because they
Basharat Ditta, 42, had become vulnerable due to his cocaine habit and he was targeted by criminal leader Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer, known by the name "Baish", was praised as the "top summary" by the criminals.
Officials saw that 32-year-old Sarboro had three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of Class A drugs, as evidenced by his hair, wallet, and credit.
Between January and August 2011, he provided information on the arrest of two men from Scarborough over a period of eight months.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time, in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside.
He and 32 other men were later sent to jail when the police seized 1.5 mil during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was giving information to criminals out of fear of his cocaine addiction being exposed.
Today in Liverpool's Crown Court, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors legal firm located in Blackburn,
They admitted to the possession of cocaine in the first hearing.
The downfall of the lawyer occurred when the police investigating in Scarborough found out about his deal with Ditta in February 2011.
Two spies followed a suspicious person and saw him reaching Ditta's house.
Immediately after the drop off, Scarboro was regularly in contact with Ditta over the phone, who was at Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home and he searched for medicines and there had been nine conversations between them.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine, as it was found on his hair, wallet, and credit card.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denied using cocaine and said that he was suspicious.
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all of them...
In the police interview, they said that they ran an office at their home address, as well as worked at the workplace.
But the court heard that he used to call the major players in the drug supply chain, among which K.
The complainant, N White said: "If anyone should not know about breaking the law, then it should be him."
Mr. Ditta has been accused of misusing his position as a criminal lawyer, because he...
The person we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer of a kind.
Some of their communications will definitely be valid because he was their lawyer.
But this lawyer-client relationship had gone far beyond the usual boundaries.
He continued to try to prevent the police investigation into his criminal activities as much as possible.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, rather he was disrespecting it.
They allowed certain customers, especially Scarborough, to get very close and they gave their own.
Ditta condemned the mistake and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I made a mistake.
But after the hearing, Lee Holstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta was then dealing with a criminal lawyer.
His cocaine addiction led him to make disappointing compromises and be influenced by the main members of organized crime groups.
Lawyers should adhere to the highest standards and they should generate trust and self-confidence in public.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his professional facade.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Mr. Ditta, in which he was accused of.
Take this matter as a warning for criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
A total of 153 years of punishment was given to 35 other men involved in the racket, which was for drug-related offenses.
Ditta conducted a question and answer session about himself on his website, in which he said that his imagination.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
"This is a terrifying place, and it is appropriate to ask: What is stopping the Constituent Assembly from establishing the judiciary tomorrow itself?"
"This law is extremely cruel and punitive, and we reject it," said the managing director of Capital Group, Sai.
They said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government," and that the content...
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill."
According to the Star Newspaper, the new bill will grant the government the right to "strangle the media", while the standard.
The time for the bill to be passed comes after the attack on Westgate Shopping Mall by Islamic gunmen in September.
Kenya's media drew the authorities' ire because they sent soldiers to the site of the attack for security.
Police headquarters David Kimaiyo summoned two journalists and a media executive for questioning as a symbol.
Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists.
If the fine is not paid to the tribunal, it also has the power to seize the offender's property.
According to Daily Nation, "A single fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."
It also said that these measures would destroy the "vibrant blogosphere" of Kenya, which it described.
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do whatever they want without the fear of punishment.
"No one will ever know," wrote journalist Mutuma Mathiu, about the Kenyan media's checks and balances in public life.
"If left to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and we would be left to hunt and gather."
Kenyan lawmakers were targeted by public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cut ordered by the National Pay Commission and won by a large margin.

No steps were being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to operate the Panchkula City Center.
They demanded the complete abolition of house tax in Panchkula.
On Friday, while addressing a press conference here, V.K. Sood said that, after the municipal elections.
Therefore, the city council has become fake and the officers are doing as they please.
Sood said that the municipal corporation has crores of rupees, but all the money is in the form of bank FDs and interest is being earned on it.
So, no steps are being taken to use that money for the development of the city.

The United Nations welcomed new goals to tackle poverty.
The United Nations is about to start working on a new set of goals, which were put in place 12 years ago.
Australian ambassadors played a significant role in promoting the "Sustainable Development Goals", which are the MDGs.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which was presented during the summit, including Miss Gillard and other world leaders.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit at night that it is now time to "rise above national interests".
"I am pleased that the member states have established and owned the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs."
These SDGs will build on the progress under our millennium development goals, and they will shape the development framework post-2015.

News of conflicts between government forces and RENAMO have been coming almost daily for the past two weeks, which has been going on for over 20 years.
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement, initially ruled by white Rhodesia and then by South Africa.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became the opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fully revert to conflict, but recent events have raised concerns.
The stakes are high for the rapidly growing economy because of the vast offshore gas reserves and the north.
The ruling Frelimo party, which has been the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo says that on October 17, the government in the Sofala province, which is traditionally a Renamo stronghold, its members.
The attacks on the former rebels increased when government forces attacked RENAMO's bases and Afonso Dhlakama.
The government has blamed Renamo for starting the conflict, accusing it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza is trying to alleviate concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhalkama considers himself a "loser".
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased when Mr. Mazanga's example was given that Renamo violated the 1992 peace agreement.
They told FT that they meant that the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
"Our perspective is that we should return to dialogue, but with seriousness," Mr. Majanga said.
The previous conversations between the parties have helped in reducing the tension generated by a series of conflicts that occurred this year.
"These two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) are rubbing heads with each other," said the Open University's.
None of them is good at making compromises and none of them is prepared to make necessary compromises.
Renamo, which is supporting electoral reforms, had already said that it will participate in the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt at an unstable movement, which is against the government.
Renamo's participation in the elections has been steadily declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique.
Mr. Majanga says that Mr. Guebuza - who will step down from his position at the end of his second term next year.
"They don't want a multi-party democracy, they don't want transparent elections, they don't want peace because they..."
It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has targeted police stations and a major north-south highway.
Most of the conflicts have occurred in the Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but also in Beira.
In June, Rio had shut down the use of railways for about a week, as Renamo had attacked the line.
When Mr. Majanga was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat, he said nothing.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that not everything is going well in Mozambique."
Instability has increased resentment towards the government, says Fernando Lima, MediaCoop, an independent media.
"People think that those who are the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and they are the ones to solve the problems."
A demonstrator, Omar Sultan, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads."
The author suggests that children should be taught old stories and scriptures as "examples of ways of life".
The stories of Thor can show that "the power of arrogance is nothing in front of the capability of subtle trickery."
Saying that many stories are "too aggressive, too insulting, and in some cases, too dirty."
"I find it amazing that in America, old stories and folklore are already a part of education," they said.
I have been supporting this as a plan for twenty years.
They added that the writer and teacher being "clearly educational" is a "complete disadvantage" for children.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, also did the Penguin Book of Norse.
Perhaps there is a difference between writing for an adult by an adult author and writing for a child by an adult author.
It's not that everything should be simplified or should reach a pleasant conclusion, but rather, it's about goodness.
And it should definitely be presented; it should be told through the medium of a story instead of being said directly.
To show based on the old foundation, not to say.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago.
The innovation of Fe has been expanded over the years, recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Carolines, this festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.
"Most of these headliners had performed at Carolines, and they achieved great success, to the point where they..."
We made this festival a way to work with them.
This year's program includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, along with "St.
As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival emerged through non-traditional channels, such as YouTube.
Nick Kroll is prominent on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's raunchy, fantasy-football-themed "The League").
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation".
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedy actors who have a unique voice (extremely pessimistic Anthony Jes
The biggest attraction of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will be talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began his career as a stand-up comedian, but he became a renowned television and film actor.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting takes place in Town Hall, located in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry's works," said Steinberg.
He was telling me that, when he is here, sometimes he walks in the alley between the two buildings and talks to himself.
The decline towards $96 per barrel of oil increases.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns over high supply overshadowed China's hunger for electricity.
The price of benchmark U.S. crude oil for December delivery in Europe late in the morning New York market.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, making it 5.8 percent lower for the month of October.
In recent weeks, the abundant supply of crude oil has put pressure on prices.
The Energy Department said on Wednesday that there was an increase of 4.1 million barrels in America's supplies last week.
In five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, two reports based on Chinese manufacturing suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic reform could strengthen further after increasing by 7.8 percent in the third quarter.
A benchmark for international crude oil that is also used by U.S. refineries.
The court has halted the decision on NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court halted an order by a judge involving the New York Police Department.
The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions are under appeal by the city.
The judge had decided in August that the city had to stop its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed against his findings and his remedial orders, in which the police department was to its policy and from it.
The appellate court heard arguments on the requested stay on Tuesday.
The appellate court said that it was necessary to remove the judge from the case because he violated the code of conduct for American judges.
The judge had ruled that the police officers had wrongly handled their stop-and-search program.
They oversaw the major changes, which include improvements in policies, training, and supervision.
In August, New York City dismissed the cases of those people who were stopped by the police, and their names and addresses were collected.
The oral argument on the city's appeal has been scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk technique has been opposed by many civil rights advocates.
Stop-and-frisk has been present in one form or another for decades, but it was under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men, all minorities, which became a class action case.
Supporters of changes in the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices.
The opponents argue that these changes will demoralize the police but not the crime, and will waste money.
The judge noted that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, and Chatra districts have participated in large numbers in the training.
All participants were trained in various subjects over a period of seven days, including tent pitching and fire making.
Training is being provided with the assistance of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Roy and Isha Ghosh.
All participants helped spread the feeling of unity by taking part in non-sectarian prayer sessions.
The camp leader and state training commissioner, Vipin Kumar, is providing special assistance.
Koolsan used phone hacking to confirm the tip.
Former "News of the World" editor Andy Coulson is accused of bribing then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
The complainant, Andrew Edis QC, told the Old Bailey that World News had spread a false rumor in May 2005.
The newspaper assigned private detective Glenn Mulcaire the task of hacking Paulby's voicemail and had him "standing at the door".
The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person who taps into people's homes.
They said that NotW used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he should know about the other, the overseer.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
They say that they didn't do it, we say "Oh yes, they did."
Rumors about Clark were first raised by the NotW's feature desk, when a source who knew Miss Paulby M.
A tape of voicemails taken from his phone on at least three occasions was seized from Malkeyar's house in August 2006.
Investigators found some entries on the private detective's computer, which included Miss Paulby and her sister as "pr.
During the period in which their investigation was being conducted, information was sought about Miss Polby from her grandparents.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup have been following Miss Paulby's progress.
On June 18, 2005, while leaving a voicemail, Coulson told him: "I have a story that we plan to run tomorrow."
Mr. Addis said that the way of involvement in Coulson's story is important for other people, such as the former Home Secretary.
The jury heard on Thursday that Kaulson had an illicit affair with a married woman, involving Mr. Blanket.
Coulson and Brooks denied the charge of hacking phones together with others from October 3, 2000 to August 9, 2006.
Mulkeyar, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to the mistake of phone hacking.

James Clapper, the American National Intelligence Director, reiterated in September that America is a foreign intelligence.
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contractor who became a whistleblower, uncovered his American surveillance secrets.
Reports that the American National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and American companies.
The final straw fell when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for quite some time.

However, the concern is that small and medium-sized companies have become vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective fields.
"Small and medium-sized companies often experience unauthorized access to protect corporate secrets."
America has warned its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
In February, the US National Intelligence Estimate named France as a second-tier offender.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "then the French are the masters."

The parents of the teenager from Georgia who died in a 'freak accident' believe that their son was murdered.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose son's body was found in their high school gym wrapped in a wrestling mat.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found standing behind the bleachers in his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators from the Lowndes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a strange accident.
"They fully believe that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he had died according to the sheriff's conclusion.
"They believe that this argument also rejects the laws of physics and common sense," Kramp said.
They think that this is a cover-up for the safety of the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body-bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that they are conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore said in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they may lead me.
My aim is to seek the truth.
"In my opinion, there is sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the preliminary postmortem indicated that Johnson's death was "situational asphyxiation".
However, according to Moore, the second postmortem listed a different cause of death.
"He said that there are many questions that need to be answered or confirmed."
Moore also added that if he were to investigate Johnson's death for criminal or civil rights violations.
Upon contacting a representative from the Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office on Thursday, an immediate response could not be obtained.

CDC has issued allergy guidelines for children in schools.
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention managed food allergies in children at school.
This is the first set of guidelines issued by the government, as school children suffer from food allergies.
Now, one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there was an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of food allergies in children.
The guide contains information for schools on how teachers and staff should respond to children's food allergies.
It also recommends that schools should have a stock of epinephrine - including the EpiPen brand auto-injector.
Recently, the state legislatures have updated the rules to allow schools to easily stock epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by those children who face an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like someone is teasing my tongue," "I feel like there is hair on my tongue."
Parents of intersex children can choose 'gender undetermined'
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies with ambiguous genitalia.
Now, newborns will not be strictly divided into male or female.
The new law does not require parents to declare the gender of such children.
The purpose of the law was to reduce pressure on those parents who were considering sex-determination surgery for their newborn babies.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman," after many years.
I will become a patchwork made by doctors, complete with injuries and scars.
Out of every 2,000 children born each year, it is estimated that one is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, a group that falls under about 60 conditions that are diagnosed as abnormalities in sexual development.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychologist in New York City who specializes in gender identity issues, said that
Ethical issues arise from intersex children.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most are saved."
You can determine gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of understanding how a child will develop any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's just like the mystery of why people are homosexual.
In a report submitted to the European Commission in 2011, intersex people were referred to as transsexual or transgender.
These characteristics are secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts, and height.
The report discusses the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the field of employment.
There are now special camps for boys who do not conform to gender norms.
Already, in Australia and Nepal, adults are allowed to identify as male, female, or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first "genderless" person, who has their own
In addition to M or F, the German passport will also have a third designation - X, for intersex, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighboring country France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from that strict Catholic country removed the "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world progresses.
A mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby John that she discriminates children based on their gender at the time of birth.
"Becoming a parent is stressful enough without any additional boundaries, especially if you have to take care of your child."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sexual organs were referred to as hermaphrodites.
And just a decade ago, the medical community considered gender as a slate that could be erased and redrawn.
But now, many people are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identification is complex.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'mental emergency'," Dresher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychologist, you called a surgeon.
Dr. John Money established the principles on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia.
They invented the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - not parents
However, in a 1966 case, referred to as "John/Joan," their principles became controversial.
She advised the parents of a boy, whose genitals were cut off in a botched circumcision, to be careful.
"Mani presented the matter as a successful transition, but it was not so," said Dresher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "practicing that model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, these gender surgery survivors came forward and said "Parin
The same happened with Jim Bruce, who was a 36-year-old writer from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes.
The doctor could not ascertain whether they had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were certain that they never could.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," they told ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but asking the question was really difficult.
At the age of 18, she was ready for her vaginoplasty.
But feeling sad and knowing that something was wrong, they demanded medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized at the time of my birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone.
After knowing the truth, he became a man again, by taking testosterone injections and removing his breasts.
The surgery made her infertile.
Today, they support others in an organization called the Intersex Project, which is for intersex individuals.
But the executive director of Advocates for Informed Choice, a legal group based in California, is N Tamar-M.
"Many workers are worried about what the German rule will do, urging parents to make quick decisions and 'the child."
We fear that this will promote interference.
We think that a better process would be to wait after determining the gender of a man or woman.
But we have not seen how the law will work, so we can only guess.
Taamar-Matis said that their organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to identify as the third gender.
"Adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about their valid gender," he said.
The German law is about allocating it at the time of birth.
This is a fight that a small child should not take up at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder.
Barretz's daughter Katie was born with a male chromosome, but she has a DSD known as complete androgen.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, female characteristics developed in Katie.

Now, 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident in Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or conception via surrogacy.
"The law gives some space to parents so that they don't rush into making decisions," Barretz said.
This gives them some time to test and understand before writing 'male' or 'female', and for a certain period of time.
So, you are right - nurture the child, love the child.
Your child is very wonderful and you enjoy it.
We do not need to rush into such a surgical procedure that is irreversible.
"This involves children in decision-making and eliminates the worry that motivates parents because they
In the end, the child will decide which gender they feel more comfortable with - and that's a wonderful thing.
This gives children the ability to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Obama campaign had considered dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisors have the Vice President on the 2012 ticket.
Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's much-anticipated 2012 election book "Double Down: Game Change 2012" has been released.
Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the President's top aide did not.
According to Jonathan Martin, the national political correspondent for Times, this book is about the campaign and the White House.
The probable switch was a mystery kept with caution within the structure of the Chicago campaign and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisors - including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina.
"Double Down" claims that Daley led the attempt to replace Biden, despite their "personal relationships".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered bringing in Clinton instead of Biden.
"I had openly talked about investigating many things, and this was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
You must remember, at that time the president was in a very bad condition, so we were thinking, "Oh Jesus Christ, what should we do?"
While Delhi described the research as "due diligence", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
"Martin doesn't spend money on polling and focus groups unless they seriously consider something,"
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was investigating the swap.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the potential changes.
While Delhi said that they don't think the President was "aware" about the potential changes, the former chief
Martin also added that "double down" certainly does not answer whether the political investigation is against Obama.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thinks that Obama should oust Biden from the ticket.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Would you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has developed a glowing snake using the fluorescent properties of marine animals.
After reading a research paper on jellyfish, they came up with this idea and Chinese scientists.
It reacts with the tongue of the ice cream eater - increases the pH level in the protein and brightens it.
Chris says that when ice cream shines in response to the heat of the mouth, it means the more you
The founder of "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, Charlie, said: "This is an incredible ingredient but still...
The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a balanced pH.
As soon as your mouth warms the protein, it will increase the pH level and the ice cream will start to shine.
We have been testing this for the past few months and it is completely suitable to share it during Halloween.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the glow of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me around £140.
Still, it tastes quite good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors which include beer.
But their next creation is going to be even more ambitious.
They said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is inherently impossible because the refraction is due to the ice crystals used in the production of ice cream.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which was developed by Chinese scientists.
The Rani Bagh market was filled with customers.
The situation was such that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
Wazirpur, Avantika Market, Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar, Central Market and Central B of Prashant Vihar.
The same scene was also observed in the jewelry shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, and Model Town.
Many people were buying gold and silver jewelry and coins.
As a result, traffic was jammed in other markets including the outer ring road.
As a result, people going from the office had to spend hours in traffic jams to get home.
Halloween 2013: According to the Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat toffee, stay up late, and play dress-up for the neighborhood.
Lately, I have become more of a miser.
I haven't signed up to distribute candy in my apartment for the past two years and probably won't this year either.
But the statistics show that in the case of Halloween, I am like a black sheep.
The majority of Americans - in fact 158 million - will be celebrating Halloween this year, with candy, costumes, and decorations.
I eagerly await one thing every Halloween, and that is trends.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), out of the $6.9 billion expenditure, $1.2 billion is the cost portion.
This year, sexy root objects are attracting everyone's attention.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can be sexy like pizza, hamburgers, and carrots.
For men, I hope we will see a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I bet.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombie, Batman, pirate, and witch.
I believe there is nothing wrong in being traditional.
Last year, we dressed up our dogs and to my surprise, we were not alone.
In fact, Americans will spend 330 million dollars on pet costumes this year, according to NRF.
They are hot dogs filled with a lot of ironies.
When it comes to candy, we don't joke around.
According to The Nielsen Company, Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars on this this year.
That is equivalent to nearly 600 million pounds of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers, and Clark bars.
This is great news for those 41 million children who come to our neighborhood to get candies on Halloween day.
In fact, we will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween and, who are we kidding, eat it.
The one thing we don't want to consume is candy corn; and yet, around Halloween, nearly 35 million pounds of it is consumed.
They are approximately 9 billion individual grains of corn.
This is a mystery that I have not yet solved.
There is nothing more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is a real car.
In fact, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted places in the United States.
In the end, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin in our childhood, and carving the Jack-o-lantern is a Christmas tradition.
We are fortunate that the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year due to Pinterest, so among us
This year, Americans spent nearly 106 million dollars on pumpkins, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The jack-o-lantern slowly withering in your front yard might have come from Illinois, which this year.

MCA said in a statement, "It was decided that the postage stamp with Sachin's picture would be released before the start of the match."
Later, there will be a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
In addition, a special coin will be used for the toss, which will be kept by the MCA.
MCA will also publish a 64-page brochure, featuring Tendulkar with business, sports, and journalists from around the world.
The association said that limited edition brochures and coins will be distributed to the members of MCA and BCCI.
They said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 scorecards, and 10,000 caps with Sachin's picture will be distributed daily.

The dream of doing good business in the fireworks market in the transportation sector could not be realized by the fireworks traders.
After the orders of the High Court, firework traders have been found to be stuck in double trouble.
They can neither trade in the temporary firecracker market in Ranjeet Avenue, nor can they transport.
After visiting the temporary firecracker market set up in Ranjeet Avenue, the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
No proper arrangements were made there, therefore a fine of one million rupees was imposed on the appropriate person.
The High Court severely criticized the Amritsar administration in its order and the use of such administration.
They have not been allocated any appropriate place in the city.
After that, they were told to provide appropriate and safe facilities and to set off firecrackers in the Jahajgarh market itself.
After this order, the fireworks traders were happy but on Friday, the police poured cold water on their happiness.
The team from the Firearm License Department arrived at the firecracker market and set up a counter to sell forms.
Perhaps the necessary conditions and rules cannot be complied with in a single day.
ASP Gaurav Garg, Head of Firearms License Branch, Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma were also present.
They were expressing dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to the fireworks traders.
Diwali is just a day away.
For this reason, the fireworks sellers were worried.
The loss of crores of rupees seemed inevitable.
Firework traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh, etc.
On Friday night, angry firecracker traders held a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjit Avenue.
They chanted slogans against the police and administration.
After that, the trade also stopped in the permanent sparkler market on Ranjeet Avenue.
A fire brigade to rescue a lost kitten stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous rock in a mine.
The Cocker Spaniel, Ruby, ran away after a minor road accident.
Three days later, a dog walker saw it trapped in a quarry.
The fire brigade descends down the face of the cliff in order to save the dog from certain death.
A puppy was fortunate to be rescued, when the fire brigade was called to safely lift it.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel, Ruby, had run away after being involved in a road accident on Sunday afternoon and was missing till Wednesday.
His owner Scott Elderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, are located in Denholme, West Yorkshire.
They anxiously searched for their missing dog and after its minor accident, it was found in the quarry.
On Wednesday, around 2:15 pm, a vigilant dog driver rescued a roob stuck 50 feet above on the quarry rock.
A technical rescue team from Kleckheaton Fire Station promptly arrived at the scene to rescue Ruby.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clutton said: 'She was in a critical situation.'
She was right in the middle of the rock - 50 feet away from the top and bottom.
During the rescue, she didn't move a muscle - she was completely frozen.
But he is fine now.
She was eating biscuits later.
This was a very unusual call-out.
It is unbelievable that the dog was seen.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby received a very fortunate rescue."
There was a possibility that she could have been seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinary doctor for examination and apart from fatigue and dehydration, everything was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said, "Watching the rescue scene was terrifying."
I couldn't believe that she was already up there.
It was wonderful to have her back in our arms.
Watson said that if she was very tired and fell, she might have already fallen.
The fire brigade was amazing.
What they were doing was very courageous.
We are very grateful and each one of them was definitely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, also added: "We were scared that it could fall, but it stayed there."
The fire brigade was splendid.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says that he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said that they were part of Jagger's 2004.
Perry said that she had dinner with the senior rocker and "when I was 18, he hit on me."
He added, "That was a long time ago, and they have been very merciful."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said that he has "clearly denied that he has.
The representative also said, "Perhaps she is misleading him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism," debuted at number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: Europe division gives Scots an alternative
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom.
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland would be included in the Europe-wide free-travel zone.
Tell stories about passport control in Berik and about the border with barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde paper mentioned the potential economic benefits of independence along with the rest of Europe.
No one explained that if they find it appropriate, the member states of the European Union can change their formal rules.
Since Scotland is no longer in the Schengen area, Scots may face consequences in Brussels for non-compliance.
So, a non-story, then.
And one that is so old that it has become a fossil: I meant "freedom means passport control" chicken.
Still, an interesting aspect has been lost in the repetition of this old story.
Why is an independent Scotland expected to comply with the orders of Europe anyway?
Why change London's chain for Brussels' chain, especially now?
Here is the real European news: The grand, post-war plan to unite Europe has ultimately been thwarted.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
In the European Union, those parties that oppose the European Union or want to end the Euro as a common currency.
In Germany too, the Eurosceptic alternative for the German party - which was only established this year - for the federal elections in September.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a Federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proven to be a significant turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, along with the adherence to the common currency at the national level.
The crisis of the Euro has very little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - this is only the case for Greece.
Rather, the Euro system has locked its members into favorable currency exchange rates for German exporters.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe faces a loss in production capacity relative to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salary and public expenditure - which has been advocated by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency issues, there is a deep European productivity malaise.
As a result of the "green" energy policies implemented by Brussels - which have an impact on the cost to the consumer in France and Germany.
This is a highly cost-effective solution, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Despite all the global wage savings, the European petrochemical industry is affected by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a rebellion is brewing, especially in France, which was once a major supporter of the European Union.
After the war, the French political class considered the European Union as a means to control Germany.
But now Berlin does not need Paris for political recognition and it has its own economic policy.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-European Union National Front has recently achieved a significant
Now, the Front is the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the votes - this is a time for British Labor.
What is Le Pen doing with her newly acquired popularity among the French white, working class?
He is using the elections of the European Union next year to form an anti-European Union in the European Parliament.
If, as is possible, the anti-European Union party performs well in these elections, then such a coalition
My argument is this: The growing sentiment against the European Union and the common currency in Europe will soon kill the Euro.
The European Union will not disappear, but it will be the loose "sovereignty" preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies can keep the Euro intact, but France and Southern Europe may not.
I hope that the UK will distance itself from this project, I hope it will get closer to America.
However, Washington's growing interest indicates towards the Pacific Ocean that Britain is cold in the Atlantic.
Where does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become (essentially) the region of Little England.
Either we can protect our own economic interests - which includes deciding where Berlin and Brussels should go.
I suspect that if we keep our own currency, Scotland could also be part of a loose European system.
It will be easier to cooperate with other countries with similar ideologies in non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider emulating Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe.
It would now be laughable for Scotland to vote for independence, only to be dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Adolescence: Growing up Fast
African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes do not mean that adolescence is near.
There is no evidence of any defects in hormones or other chemicals.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could potentially be a trigger for early onset of puberty.
This tendency is not so clear with boys that adolescence is coming soon.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who is an expert in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts getting breast buds and pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Child Endocrine.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, it's a sign of rapid progress towards full adolescence."
Clear signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair, and body odor, occur in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been only a slight change in the age of menarche (first menstruation).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which has decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
"Once the breasts start to develop, menarche (the beginning of menstruation) occurs at least two to three years later."
Time is the most accurate test to determine how adolescence will progress.
It is debatable what is considered the actual beginning of adolescence, but when the breast development starts from the age of 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which a hair doctor will closely monitor.
Upon rapid progression, serious issues like tumors or cysts are denied by the endocrinologist.
Treatments are available to delay the onset of initial menstruation and prevent another outcome: premature bone aging.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy depend on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Socio-psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is cautious about medications, but believes, "Suppressing adolescence can reduce behavioral problems."
The second major problem that can be understood is: Parents just have their very young daughters menstruating.
"They worry about the risks of conception or even how they will cope with cleanliness," Kaplov.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter started her menstrual cycle at the age of 10.
Still, while there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and upset from school, because she was the first among her friends.
There are several famous theories about the causes of unnecessary adolescence.
Still, for hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys - like girls - are growing up fast towards adolescence.
Caplovitz claims that the most important principle is the epidemic of obesity.
They conducted a study in 2001, in which girls aged 6 to 9 years were studied.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various clarifications.
On a global level, the patterns of early adolescence are influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate.
Another puzzle: Although hair has started to grow on boys' faces and genitals at a younger age, it hasn't fully started yet.
Other doctors present at the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the subject.
The emergence of pimples and pubic hair is also common in infants and children.
"We need to be vigilant about recognizing the onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman.
Parents should seek guidance from their pediatrician about ways to communicate with their child.
"This could mean that a conversation might happen sooner than expected," Kaplovitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child usually responds well.
Girls who mature early need to ensure that, if this program is ahead of time.
A drop of 3.1 degrees in temperature was recorded on Thursday.
The rain and cool breeze on Wednesday night made people feel cold.
On Thursday, people went out to the market and their other places wearing sweaters.
People took out their quilts after the first rain of winter.
People were seen enjoying the morning sun.
Once the weather changes, there will be relief from cold and other diseases, but after that, clouds will be with the sun.
The child went to school even wearing a sweater.
According to the Air Force Weather Department, the maximum temperature on Thursday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7.
7.8 millimeters of rainfall was recorded.
According to the weather department, the sky will be covered with clouds.
Dispute over seat width among jet manufacturers, risk to large orders
Controversy over the width of economy class seats on long-haul flights among leading aircraft manufacturers.
The controversy is focused on the width of the seats provided for economy passengers on long flights.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which requires a minimum of 18 inches (46 centimeters) in the economy cabin.
The controversy arises when the aircraft manufacturer sometimes increases the size of its twin-engine long-haul aircraft.
What is the arrangement of the rear part of the plane - especially that the seats are 9 or 10 respectively - this is the new "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says their new version "777X" will accommodate 406 people, with seats wider than 17 inches.
Airbus claims that its competitive version of the A350 has 9 rows of 18-inch wide economy seats in the 350.
Aircraft giants often quarrel over technical matters through advertisements in trade magazines.
Now, Airbus is directly appealing to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X has received over 100 orders.
Recently, he showed a slide to financiers that could mark the beginning of a new advertising war.
"Boeing has proposed that they can also operate short-haul flights for long distances."
People are getting bigger due to changes in diet, but there hasn't been much change in the size of airplane seats.
In the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo redefined modern long-distance travel, and until the dawn of the century,
According to U.S. health statistics, the average waist size of an American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus claims that their competitors are stuck on the concept of a 1950s seat, when it was known as "Jet Set".
Airbus states that they have issued a research order in which it has been suggested to widen the seat.
Boeing disputes the seat measurements of Airbus and argues that manufacturers should intervene in determining this.
It also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends more on the width of the seat.
"This is really about providing flexibility to the airlines and allowing them to do those things."
They don't want us to tell them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
This is more about elbow room for those taking flight, but for suppliers, it's a slow and steady process.
Behind the controversy is a race for airplane orders, in which at least 700 billion will be spent on list prices in the coming decades.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the same as that of the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that their latest long-haul, twin-engine designs have it.
It partially depends on Boeing's claims of performance that they compare the 10-row 777X to the original 9-row.
The profit made in unit cost has been reduced compared to the now implemented 10-line rule.
"Boeing is doing this so that it can add more seats to its aircraft and increase competition with our products."
On the other hand, analysts suggest that the existing 10-seat-per-row cabins for the current 777s indicate that many
"An eighteen-inch seat width would be very good for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they supply to airlines for selection.
Jet sellers who travel globally take technical measurements so they can check the competitor's layout.
Claiming convenience, all manufacturers offer low-cost airlines and regional travel for high density.
Airbus presents a 10-row A350 but says it has not yet been sold.
Until recently, Airbus has been offering wide aisle seats on some of its jets to meet the increasing need for cabin customization.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer making large modern jets, experts say that it's a new one.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could end the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine saved rats from a lifetime addiction to nicotine.
Before the commencement of human trials, more tests are needed, which will take several years, but no.
"We have great hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers."
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry genetic information.
This virus selectively infects liver cells, after which they produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies hunt for any nicotine molecules present in the bloodstream, rendering them ineffective.
In the tests, the mice that were vaccinated and later given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But those mice that were not vaccinated "became calm," say researchers, this is a sign.
The description of the experiments has been done in the Science Translation Medical Journal.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines needed to be administered so frequently to maintain the level of antibodies that they became expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine will likely be much lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody production factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine is completely safe in the future, it should be given to children for their protection.
But it is more likely that smokers will use this to quit.
"They know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any pleasure from it due to the nicotine patch."
British scientists said that the results were intriguing but warned that more research was needed.
The cause of the tigress's death was not clear even after the post-mortem.
The Forest Department, in a evasive response, said that at first glance, the tigress's death seems to be natural.
On Thursday night, the forest officials of the Pavagadh Conservation Reserve of the Ramnagar Forest Department found one near the Khichdi stream.
The tigress's body was completely safe and no signs of injury or wounds were found on the body.
On Friday, CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabag veterinarian Hema Rathore performed a check-up on the tigress under the supervision of Forest Conservator, Vivek.
According to sources, during the postmortem, the tigress's internal organs were found to be damaged.
Due to this, the actual cause of the tigress's death could not be determined.
The department officials are giving evasive answers about the tigress's death.
However, the internal organs were sent to IVRI Bareilly for toxicology testing to check for the presence of poison.
Vivek Pandey, the forest conservator of the Western Circle, said that the tigress's death could be considered natural.
There were no signs of poison in the body.
However, the surrounding areas were searched and the viscera was sent for testing for the presence of poison.
Tripodi has denied being influenced by Obed.
The investigation of former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be conducted by the state's corruption watchdog.
Former NSW Minister Joe Tripodi, on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, intervened in the maritime lease policy.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday into whether Mr. Obeid was involved in corruption.
Now an investigation is underway to determine whether Mr. Tripodi had knowledge of Mr. Obeid's hidden interests in the properties or not.
During the annual discussions that began in 2005, the government was pushing Lease for public tender.
The subtenants were against it and they also wanted a longer duration.
In 2009, the leases for Circular's enterprises, which used to earn Obaid about 2.5 million dollars annually, were terminated.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Ports Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of public tenders.
However, they denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who admitted that Mr. Tripo.
A phone transcript table kept in ICAC revealed that between August and September 2007, Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodi.
"Was the development of the commercial lease policy being discussed during these telephone conversations?" asked the Assistant Commissioner.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we discussed, but it definitely wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obed.
Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria, officials say.
A senior administrative official has confirmed to Fox News that an Israeli warplane was involved on Thursday night.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but he said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press report, the target was the SA-125 missile made in Russia.
Earlier this year, Israel had launched air strikes at least twice on missile shipments inside Syria.
Foreign workers on a 457 visa may undergo a "reality" test.
The government is considering a "genuineness" test for the 457 visa for foreign employees, as it is a crackdown.
If the test is adopted, it will be implemented through a standard, the purpose of which is to support 457s.
Today, a government discussion paper was issued when former Labor MP Maxine McHugh criticized the government's foreign laborers.
Forceful declarations about foreigners going to the back of the queue and 'Australian jobs first' are very significant.
Historically, this meant that there was a need to protect white workers - and if some people in the area did
The discussion paper mentions 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about human trafficking.
If the "purity" criterion was adopted, the visa applicant could be checked for "whether the nomination was made then.
Businesses may also need to keep track of the number of 457 visa holders, whereas previously they did not need to.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee arrived on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The distressed nine-year-old son of that man had gone with him to Australia and since his father's death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities immediately took the man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
Announcement of a study aimed at enhancing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland in the UK.
The suggestion made by HS2 Ltd indicates that high-speed services to the north of Scotland and England will be 202.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that this project will "bring the UK together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he is "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.
In the first phase, there will be a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the work of the second phase is completed, the lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government estimated the cost of building a high-speed link between London and the north of England to be £32.7bn.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has directed HS2 Limited to Northern England and S.
This includes the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London, which is approximately three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal is a truly national network for HS2 that connects the UK and its cities.
We are advancing HS2 because the benefits to be gained from it are immense.
Without this, we would have to face a capacity crisis on our rail network.

Decision to keep the airplane electronic device regulations in place for now in Australia.
Passengers of Australian Airlines are required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing.
The American Federal Aviation Administration has paved the way for American carriers to provide their services to passengers.
Passengers are already allowed to do this for most of the flight duration, but many people are excited.

However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could potentially benefit passengers and we are definitely
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and it will depend on their fleet of aircraft.
Carriers will need to prove that their aircraft can withstand radio interference from mobile devices.

Pawnbrokers are shining in Singapore as the middle class is feeling the pinch.
In a pawn shop at Bendemeer Shopping Center in Singapore, Janani Amritalinga is pawning for her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is tied up there," said Mrs. Ameerthalingam.
Still, she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, but the monthly family income is...
In fact, in some parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is increasing - Volumax, where
Pawning jewelry is not just a way to quickly obtain cash - in the case of Miss Ameerthalingam.
Generally, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge a fee of 17 percent per annum, which is only in June.
However, the advantage for those who pawn is that they do not need a credit check or proof of salary.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are under pressure from rising living costs and increasing domestic and consumer debt.
After the global financial crisis, five years of strong growth, and laxity in advanced economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's has raised concerns about increasing domestic debt, mainly on the rise.
It was said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest domestic debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia has achieved the highest position in the list with 80% GDP, which was 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which is in crisis this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuous weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
The main point is that when costs are rising, people from middle to lower income levels try to save wherever possible.
In the last two years, the historically high prices of gold have fueled a rush to pawn personal items.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items kept in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
"People are saying, 'The price of gold looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and retrieve it next month."
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, Easymoney, has recently seen an increase in the use of its outlets in recent months.
The growth of Valuemax, Bendemeer, and operators of 15 other similar outlets in Singapore, is so much that
The company will fund this using 60 percent of the S$66m raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some lenders are on fire for high interest rates, Miss Yah says that only pawned
"Customers are making those items hostage which they already have the right to, and personal properties are being ignored."
Social acceptance of large-scale business as a means for short-term secure financing.
Not only financially stressed people, but also people of other types use pawnbrokers.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches.
We see customers at every stage of life.
"This includes wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business plans or investments."
Sometimes they need money very quickly.

Tassi Health's $325 million rescue package.
The central government claims that the ailing health system of Tasmania will benefit from a rescue package of 325 million dollars.
Central Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the elderly population of the Union Island State, u
The decision on funding for four years was made with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie in government consultation.
"The government has come forward with an emergency rescue package, we believe that this will be addressed by the state."
The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.
An additional 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help in reducing the delay.
There is also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical.
"These investments respond to the concerns expressed to me by frontline clinicians that this is what Tasmania needs."
The minister emphasized that the Tasmanian government will have to face a strict reporting and accountability system.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth cash and it will be on a monthly basis.
A commission of three individuals will be formed to ensure that state services are as effective as possible.
Mr. Vilki said today that $325 million will not matter "until after this, for the public health of Tasmania".
Still, they praised the government because for the first time in May, they had started with the Prime Minister.
"I am optimistic that the central aid package will rescue the state's public health system from the crisis list."
According to the state government, these additional electoral processes will largely reverse the recent cuts.
However, the central opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is a "temporary solution".
"We are here because the Labor state government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from its health system," he said.
You cannot see a state government withdrawing nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth has 300 million dollars.
Mr. Dutton urged Miss Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar is wasted from the rescue package.

Anger over the punishment of Bali Bomb Conspirator
The grief-stricken relatives and survivors of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings have conspired against the conspirators.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted in Southeast Asia,
If they get parole, they could be released within 15 years.
A 45-year-old was found guilty of massacre for the attacks on two nightclubs, which are in the popular tourist area of Kuta.
They were accused of several acts of terrorism, including the bombings on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, however, they could also have mentioned that he was known as the "destructive man".
This decision is rekindling painful memories for Parth's mother, June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old son.
Holding back tears, he said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think that he should follow in the footsteps of other boys.
"She should be put in front of a firing squad," Miss Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without seeing my grandchildren and daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when an explosive bomb, which had been loaded in a van, was detonated in the outdoor parking area.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's where a suicide bomber had filled a backpack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the bomb blast, he went into a coma for a month, and while on life support, he "died" three times.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have faced the same fate as the three Jamaah Islamiyah terrorist cell.
In fact, this man should receive the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring hundreds, 20 years is not much.
Patek is the last criminal of the Bali bombing who is facing justice.
They managed to evade capture for almost a decade, but were eventually caught in Abbottabad, Pakistan in January 2011.
During the period, an FBI agent testified that confidential reports had revealed that Patek was.
"He did not dedicate himself," said Miss Courtin.
Until recently, he really didn't regret how much pain he had caused others.
The decision comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be commemorated with events in Bali and Australia.
"Many tears will be shed this year," said Miss Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Airplane passengers are now allowed to use devices on planes (but cannot make mobile phone calls)
Airline passengers are allowed to use their electronic devices from gate to gate for reading, working, playing games, etc.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a press conference that how quickly the change will be implemented depends on the airline company.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA has said that it wants to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes from some airlines.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted their plans.
"Depending on the situation of the plan, we will soon approve the extensive use of electronic devices."
Currently, passengers are requested to switch off their smartphones and tablets after the airplane doors are closed.
They are not to restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane is descending for landing.
Under the new guidelines, aviation companies whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference, travel.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that are being replaced allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes.
Laura Glading, the president of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we are in tight dialogue with the carrier to do it."
We are tired of feeling like a 'hall monitor' directly in relation to this issue.
But permission to connect to the internet, surf, exchange emails, text or download data.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets, and other devices to airplane mode.
So, still no Words With Friends, which is an online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing in 2011.
And the relocation of heavy equipment like laptops will continue because there is concern that they will be scattered around the cabin.
Making cellphone calls will also remain prohibited on the flight.
The regulatory authority over phone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on carrying and using certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is the national transportation safety correspondent for CBS News.
"Mobile phones, it's really an issue, not only because it possibly interferes with navigational devices."
An industry advisory committee formed by the FAA recommended last month that the government allow personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increasing pressure on the FAA to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for the bans.
With the common use of devices, the implementation of restrictions is also increasing.
Some studies suggest that a third of passengers ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began banning the use of passengers' electronic devices in 1966, when passengers started using FM.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems compared to the previous generation of aircraft.
Airlines have been providing passengers with the facility to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for many years.
Wi-Fi systems are more resistant than revised aircraft obstruction.
Huerta said that under the new guidelines, a large number of airliners will have more electronic devices.
Today's electronic devices generally transmit lower power radio compared to the devices of the previous generation.
For example, e-readers only refresh when turning the page.
But transmission becomes stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Some of them are demanding to ease the restrictions on the use of travelers' equipment, including Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's officer filled an airliner with their Kindle e-readers and tested it for problems.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers has said that he believes that the equipment is responsible.
Members of the other committee said that there are only verbal reports from pilots that support the claim about the equipment.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to instruct pilots to communicate with passengers during mechanical descents in low visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, allowing them to now travel equipped with technical tools.
"We are pleased that the FAA believes that passenger enjoyment is not incompatible with safety and security," said the U.S.

Trade for Britain began in April with a promise to bring business together and it is still ongoing.
For this, we have obtained the perspectives of British business leaders about Britain, trade, and the European Union.

A better deal for British trade is possible, and it is moving towards the economic and financial union of the Eurozone.
Priority should be given to jobs and development in Britain and, as our survey findings are showing.

Before the allegations against Jonathan Lord, two YMCA employees were accused of sexual offenses, according to the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA NSW employees were accused before raising allegations against Caringbah child welfare worker Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in his initial statement to the commission, he said that he had "in his organization, sexual abuse of children.

They admitted that the initial statement of the YMCA for the commission was also deemed incorrect, in which the claim was made.
The commission has evidence that UMC was informed in August this year by the Education and Community Department.
Mr. Her, who started with the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that from him down to the bottom, everyone accepted.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was accused at the YMCA for sexual misconduct against 12 boys during his two-year tenure.

New Express, located in Guangzhou, has made a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had told stories about a company in which he had a stake.
The new express is now going for a "complete overhaul," the regulator said.
The order for "improvement" came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group has been operating since September 2012.

It said that it has decided to impose administrative penalties on Chen Yongzhou, revoking his reporter's license.
It had instructed the "Yancheng Evening News Group" to fully revise the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express, in which he discussed a construction tool named Zoomlian.
After he was taken into custody, his newspaper published a two-page appeal for his release.

Found a US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway.
The most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel between America and Mexico has been discovered, which has its own elevator.
American authorities have discovered a tunnel four feet wide and three feet high, which they consider to be the largest they have ever found.
The tunnel, which zigzags approximately the length of six football fields, is between Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego.
The area is filled with obscure warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with intoxicating drugs.
Government officials said that the tunnel was closed before any illicit drugs could be seized.

The bubble of London will burst due to tax on foreign property owners.
The Treasury Department has set a temporary price for the CGT measure, but they are waiting for the final decision from Mr. Osborne.
The stamp duty for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster, Kensington, and Chelsea is already high.
Mr. Cook said, "Increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and related anti-avoidance measures."
"But this step could deter some foreign investors from buying property in London or current owners from selling."
The main property - valued at the top 5% to 10% of the residential market - is in the wealthy South-West London belt.
In Central London, a steady annual increase of 5.6% in prices continued, but an emerging "domestic market" is also being observed.
Scientists have further clarified how the movements of a dog's tail are connected to its temperament.
Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's perspective).
But now scientists say that companion dogs can see these subtle tail differences and can understand them.
The study has been published in the Current Biology Journal.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trento University, said: "This is very common in humans.
We tried to observe it here in other species.
They also added that just like in humans, the right part of the brain is also right for dogs.
To find out how dogs react to other dogs wagging their tails, researchers have... (The sentence is incomplete)
They measured the heart rate of domestic animals and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps it won't take us long to understand why their tail goes in one direction sometimes, and in another direction at other times.
Professor Vailortigara said, "We showed dogs films of dogs - either a natural version or an edited one."
When animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (tail wagging)
But when they saw that a tail was moving to the left (again from the perspective of a tail-wagging dog), primarily.
Professor Vailortigara said that he doesn't think dogs communicate with each other through these tricks.
Instead, they believe that dogs learn from experience about what things they should worry about.
They said, "If you often meet with other dogs and their tail often wags to one side, then...
Researchers say that these results should inform owners, veterinary doctors, and trainers about their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, who is from the Veterinary Science School of Bristol University.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their head.
And in another research paper from the University of Victoria, Canada, they said: "Dogs were more likely to...
They said that the difference could be because in various studies, dogs have been used in films or as animals.
They explained how studying dogs can help in understanding the actual reactions of real dogs.
While there is ample evidence from various mammals that both sides of the brain serve different purposes.
However, considering the ease of recording their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand that

Pope Francis will name the first Cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church under the Pope, and they are the ones who elect the Pope.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he is not allowed to participate in the election of the Pope - this task is limited to 120.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi said that the new Cardinal
"Lombardi said, "Pope Francis has communicated his decision to convene the Consistory of February."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely decrease.
They said that usually a Pope nominates as many Cardinals as needed.
Valero said that next year's consistory will be important because it will be chosen in March this year by Francis.
Currently, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to maintain balance."
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a very small number of Cardinals.
The Cardinals will be chosen by Francis for the first time since the creation of the Cardinals' Council, which consists of eight Cardinals from around the world.
In the past, the Pope used to decide everything by himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals for his help," Valero said.
They said it is "quite possible" that they will seek advice from the French Cardinals.
But we were never in that situation before - this is all completely new.
Valero said that the Pope usually elevates bishops of large places to the position of Cardinal, but Francis "
GM has recalled some new pickup trucks in America for seatback repair.
General Motors Company is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.
In some trucks, there may be a defect in the swinging mechanism of the front seats.
As a result, seatbacks cannot comply with federal auto safety standards due to head restraints.
"If a vehicle is hit from behind, the head restraint cannot properly protect the passengers, which can cause injury."
The recalled models were made between August 1 and September 10.
The launch of GM's truck began in June and it became number 1 American automobile after the bankruptcy reorganization of 2009.
GM informed truck owners about the fault in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the owner's notification letter due to a 16-day government shutdown, which affected auto sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, in the first year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, GM's shares were up 1.4 percent at $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange.
A Cry of Despair from an Obama Voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in the possibility of change.
They say that GOP's obstructionism has stopped Obama's worthy efforts.
Apologism cannot excuse the problems of the Obamacare website and drone attacks.
Obama's 2008 electoral autobiography reminds us of the painful memory of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book these days.
This is a book that I thought would inspire me during the apathy of the second year of medical school.
This is called "The Audacity of Hope", and it is the autobiography of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish with my patient's paperwork at night and get into bed, the book then...
The election turned out to be a landslide victory, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates started crying with joy, and my parents saved all the newspapers they could get.
A group of young, visionary people were leading towards the White House, for the transformation of the nation.
During the transition to Obama's office in 2008, his approval rating was 82%.
And then I close the book.
Making a compromise in the present is a harsh awakening, like coming out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic days - they seem like a distant memory, a painful reminder of missed opportunities.
Indeed, a change occurred since I cast my first vote.
This was nothing straightforward that I could have imagined.
I credit Obama for his great and diverse achievements, including the passing of the Affordable Care Act.
I believe that partisan obstructionism has reversed many efforts to advance our nation: Anonymous
But, after those countless times when I defended the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and peers.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Democratic obstructionism does not permit the backing of foreign leaders nor does it allow for the exploitation of innocent children in foreign countries.
This is about the National Security Agency collecting data on the private lives of Americans and not even a government mistake.
It cannot be held responsible for the extrajudicial killing of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, nor for the national security.
The findings of a report cannot support the claim that there is an attempt to silence the White House's media.
And, most recently, this hospital facility act has been simplified after more than three years of being amended in the law.
I don't know if this is what I had hoped for.
If, at the age of 18, I should have understood that the governance system is due to its previous political campaigns.
Clearly, the election office is not a predictable course, as it is subject to the opposition political party and chance.
Still, from all the examples listed above, they mostly seem to be the administration's preference.
That is what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was inspired by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a misleading and unrefined option that fails to ensure his policies or positions.
I felt that for Obama, for the second time, free from the pressure of future elections, we heard the hope we had been hearing for so long.
Still, as Obama's approval rating fell below 45% this week, he went back through that book for 2008.
This compels me to search for all those promises that have disappeared.
This week, I read the part of the book that described how Obama won the Pennsylvania primary.
In the meeting after the death campaign, he told his employees to return to their path and their own.
"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The opinion expressed in this comment is solely that of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that there is a conflict of interest in Prime Minister Tony Abbott's parental leave scheme.
Millionaire MP Clive Palmer says that his interests are with Prime Minister Tony Abbott's maternity leave scheme.

"They have a major struggle in the case of paid maternity leave, because if any of their daughters..."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially awarded Mr. Palmer the Fairfax seat of Sunshine Coast.
Mr. Palmer demanded a recount of the election so that the process could be expedited.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the decision of this election be made two months after we stop voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you go, enter your details in a computer, and vote immediately?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils on ballot papers.
Is this because if someone doesn't like the result, they can erase it?
Having a pencil in this day and age seems extraordinary.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting and has recently collaborated with New Zealand.
Palmer Ji, 59, said that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast.
A public position is about public service.
"We don't want any reward, except the reward of history, that we can serve society at a crucial time," they said.
Because of this, the protesters had to endure.
Addressing the people gathered for the occasion, the President of the Bar Association, Ramesh Singh Negi, addressed the state.
They said that the increasing number of attacks on lawyers and their families shows that criminals have become fearless.
They are no longer afraid of the police and administrative system.
Citing various such attacks, they said that if lawyers themselves are not safe, then we are certain.
RBS has suspended two foreign currency traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign currency department.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that
These two traders will be RBS employees who will spread with the echo of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspension, has confirmed this month that it has information from the regulators.
"Our investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators."
Last month, people close to the situation had said that RBS had submitted the records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator.
This businessman, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and it is believed that he is from his current position.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, went on leave this week, while Barclays also...
No allegations of any wrongdoing have been made against any of these traders.
Mr. Usher's immediate message group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to people close to the situation.
UBS said this week that it has taken action against some of its employees, after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it is.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, and the Competition Authority of Switzerland.
HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or are in compliance with regulators.
Banks are scouring years of instant messages and emails in search of incidents of mistakes.
News about the investigation has shaken the traders who have been trading in investment banks for the past few years.
Some bankers have tried to downplay this issue, arguing that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is difficult to manipulate.
A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trade, various trade platforms are struggling.
The news came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had launched its London Exchange Traded Fund this week.
The bank has promptly informed the concerned authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe that the trader acted alone and the matter has been resolved," said Credit Suisse.

It is true that we cannot go on without money.
Money is one of the most important necessities for life, but considering it as the most important thing is wrong for us.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Trayodashi in the month of Kartik.
During Dhanteras, the God of Wealth, Kuber, and the God of Death, Yama, are worshipped.
Wealth plays an important role in our religion and life.
Money is neither good nor bad.
Our attitude towards money can be either good or bad.
There is nothing more valuable than the wealth used for the benefit of humanity, but if wealth becomes the cause of arrogance.
Wealth should be acquired with a sacred purpose and it should also be spent on sacred purposes.
It is everyone's duty to earn money for the prosperity of the family.
There should also be some sentiment for social expenditure, but the tendency to accumulate or create wealth by any means should not be there.
We should always have a feeling of charity in our mind.
Even a small portion of your wealth that you give can become the basis of someone's livelihood.
Many people in society are living in extreme poverty. We all should think about them.
In fact, wealth, religion, desire, and salvation are given equal importance in all areas of life.
Everyone desires wealth and success, and how hard they work depends on their pursuit of wealth and success.
Wealth acquired with self-respect alone is long-lasting.
No criminal, no matter how wealthy they become, can ever truly enjoy their wealth.
Do not envy a wealthy person.
True prosperity is that which creates the possibility of wealth flowing through many hands.
There can be no better use of money than creating jobs for others.
Pay attention, wealth does not just come in the form of money.
Health, character, and love for others are also a kind of wealth.
Try to acquire the right to this kind of amount of money.

The Special Task Force (STF) exposed a scam in the 2012 PMT just a day ago.
STF found discrepancies in the registration numbers of 700 students.
Approximately 125 of them had been admitted to the medical college.
Now the admission process of these students will be cancelled.
After the revelations by the STF, the medical examination department has started considering the cancellation of these students' admissions.

The list will be sent to PEB so that the eligibility of the included students can be cancelled.
However, in this matter, the department is also considering seeking legal advice.
Departmental officials said that the students nominated in 2012 have completed one year, hence legal advice.

If, after the general elections, the new government continues the policy of not selling kerosene through ration shops,
Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are among the states where the sale of kerosene will be stopped.
In addition to these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and some states in the Northeast are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources from the Ministry of Petroleum, the decision to stop the sale of kerosene through PDS shops is based on two criteria.
The first criterion is that the supply of electricity is being rapidly established in rural areas.
The second criterion is the LPG supply network.
This means that in those states where most rural households have gas connections, there is PDS kerosene.
The Ministry of Petroleum is fully prepared for this.
The sale of PDS kerosene has been stopped in Delhi since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Uttarakhand has been significantly reduced.
The quota of 2.72 lakh kiloliters of Punjab has been reduced to one lakh kiloliters.
The kerosene quota allocation for Haryana has been reduced by 70% and for Uttarakhand by approximately 40%.
Despite this shortage, no information about a shortage of kerosene has been given by these states.
The Ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene is used for adulteration.
Currently, there is a difference of 37 rupees in the price of diesel and PDS kerosene.
This encourages those who are adulterating.
In those states where the sale of kerosene has been stopped through PDS shops, oil companies are in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are selling kerosene at a loss of Rs.39 per liter.
The estimated burden of kerosene subsidy in 2013-14 is 31,000 crore rupees.
Claiming to be a commercial company, the accused opened accounts for investors and sold and bought shares.
This is possibly the first time in the state that such a fraud, involving crores of rupees, has been detected.
The police have not yet been able to catch the gang leader, but the police are investigating his activities in the state.
This gang was running a fictitious clothing market called Metatrader-5.
The company's directors used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs with the help of counterfeit software.
With these, the accused could see which shares the investors were buying.
They also knew which shares were being bought and at what price.
In reality, no shares were purchased, nor any transactions were made, because there was no demat account for the investors.
The police suspect that hundreds of people were deceived by the gang.
Every investor was told to invest two to five lakh to get good profits.
The main accused, Amit Soni, was taken into custody by the Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while his six associates were arrested in Indore.
According to Cyber Cell ADG, Ashok Dohre, every stock trading company should act as a trading firm in the form of a stock exchange.
Only after that will the company have the ability to attract investors to trade stocks through their platform.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that stock trading can be done, but this company does not use MetaTrader-5.
This company purchased a server under the name of Wintrade on September 24, 2012.
Since then, this company has been deceiving people with fake investments.
So far, eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to lodge complaints with the cyber cell.
After selling their shares in the profit, the amount was not transferred to their accounts.
Then they began demanding the promised benefits from the company's executive officers.
Investors are even saying that their fake IDs were always showing a decrease in the price of the shares they bought.
This price was set by the accused themselves.
The company had appointed a CEO and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.
The agents enticed people to join the company by promising substantial benefits.
After that, some people invested two to five lakh rupees.

However, contrary to the claims made by Modi during the NDA government (between 1994 to 2004), when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in power.
On Thursday, in Kevadia, Gujarat, the 182-meter tall statue of Sardar Patel, 'Statue of Unity' was inaugurated.

When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, "Consider it as spending on advertising.

Jemef Bwele was injured in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
Initially, they only had a broken arm injury, but the infection developed and spread to their brain.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwelle.
If we had money, we would take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwele spent many years taking her father to crowded clinics and hospitals.
"This is not easy," Bwele said.
You can leave the house at 5 in the morning, to be the first to run to the hospital, and still you may not be the first.
The number of patients is very high.
Some people may die because they are waiting.
There hasn't been much change in the situation since Bawele's father passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, in the United States of America, there is a ratio of one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could meet a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford to buy and get treatment.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the country's expenditure on healthcare is.
"Their only problem is poverty," Bwele said.
And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing his father and so many countrymen in pain, Bwele decided that he would do something about it.
Dr. George Bevlee and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself, and was working as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
And they started a non-profit organization, ASCOVEME, which operates in rural areas on weekends.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into a van, tie medical supplies on the roof, and go.
Their luck doesn't always favor them.
They had to push vehicles through rivers and mud, and that too more than once.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed by true heroes: a feast, song and dance, and the community.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bvele - with his big smile and
The next morning, the team begins to meet with hundreds of patients.
"We are reaching 500 people in each journey," Bwele said.
They are coming from around 60 kilometers around the village, and they are coming on foot.
Various types of medical care are provided in all these weekend clinics.
Many people get treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive Baisakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documentation that can be used for school.
In the evening, the team will perform general surgeries with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a schoolhouse, town hall, or home; after the procedure, the patient gets up and moves on to the next.
The operating room's light and cleaning equipment, from the group's generator, the bowls, and their volunteers on Sunday morning.
This is a difficult pace, but the village musicians usually help to motivate the team.
"They are playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwele said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year.

In addition to managing these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwele Yaounde also...
They said that this is the second job that funds almost 60% of their non-profit organization.
"I don't know when they sleep," said a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like Omali, who come from the United States and Europe to participate in the mission in Bwele.
"We have been given the opportunity to assist in surgery where we wipe the blood or hold instruments for Dr. Bwele."
There is nothing that you will get to do as a second-year medical student in America.
Student volunteers usually bear their own expenses to go to Cameroon, often donated medical supplies.
But once they reach Yaounde, their board, transportation, and directions are managed by Bwele.
"He is definitely a hero," O'Malley said.
He dedicates his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is permanent.
For Bwele, the constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others in their happiness, fulfilling the promise made to his father, gives him great joy.
"I feel very happy while doing this work," Bwele said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, to lessen the pain.
