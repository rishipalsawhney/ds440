Albert Barnett and his wife, Susan Barnett, from the West Church in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
Strong storms swept through the Southern and Central regions of the United States on January 11 and 12, 2020.
Two days of heavy rain, strong winds, and multiple tornadoes have caused serious damage in many states.
It is truly regrettable that Mr. Albert Barnett and his wife, Mrs. Susan Barnett, aged 85 and 75 respectively, lost their lives when a tornado struck their mobile home.
Authorities in the United States also reported that at least four houses of our fellow countrymen were slightly damaged, along with two churches.
In addition, the storms caused significant damage to the business assets of an older brother.
Local elders and district supervisors are providing practical and emotional support to those affected by this disaster.
We know that our Heavenly Father, Jehovah, is bringing comfort to our brothers and sisters who are grieving over this tragedy.
Government agencies and international officials have reacted to the decision of the Russian Supreme Court to declare the worship practices of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia as illegal.
These statements have criticized Russia's unjust and harsh legal actions against a minority religious group known for their peaceful religious activities.
On July 17, 2017, a panel of three judges from the Russian Supreme Court confirmed the decision of April 20 by the Court to "liquidate the religious organization 'Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia'".
With this decision, the court effectively banned the followers of the Catholic Apostolic Church in Russia.
Below is an excerpt from the statements made after the decision on July 17, 2017, by the Appellate Chamber of the Supreme Court of Russia to uphold the decision on April 20.
We are very concerned about the decision of the Russian Supreme Court to reject the appeal of the Jehovah's Witnesses being labeled as 'extremist'.
This decision confirms the criminalization of the peaceful religious activities of 175,000 Russian citizens and violates the freedom of religion rights enshrined in the Russian Constitution.
- Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister of State for Human Rights, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, United Kingdom.
The decision of the Russian Supreme Court this week regarding Jehovah's Witnesses is the latest development in the concerning trend of persecution against minority religious groups in Russia.
We call on the Russian authorities to lift the ban on the activities of followers of the Japanese Church of the Lord in Russia, and to reverse the closure of the Administrative Center of the followers of the Japanese Church of the Lord.
- Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the US Department of State.
"The Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religions, must have the ability to enjoy peaceful assembly without interference, as guaranteed in the Constitution of the Russian Federation, as well as"
The spokesperson for the External Action Service of the European Union.
The decision of the Supreme Court regrets the continuous reflection of the government's connection between the practice of religious freedom and extremism.
Witnesses are not an extremist group, and they should be able to practice their faith openly and freely without being oppressed by the government.
- Daniel Mark, Chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.
I am very concerned that the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia has been upheld.
Although we have called for it at various levels, this movement has made the enjoyment of peace, freedom of religion, and thought a crime.
- Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and Eastern Partnership Countries in the German Foreign Office.
Russia's recent decision to ban Jehovah's Witnesses from existing as a recognized religious community in Russia is a clear violation of the rights to freedom of religion and belief as outlined in Article 18 of the Declaration.
People with good souls from all religious communities as well as all those who value the right to freedom of conscience must stand in solidarity with the Jewish community leaders in Russia.
- Dr. Katrina Lantos Swett, Chair, Lantos Foundation.
Before the decision of the Court of Appeals, many government agencies and officials condemned the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia on April 20th.
"I have requested President Vladimir Putin to use his influence to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities here as well as with the Four Noble Truths group."
- Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a press conference with President Putin.
"The recent decision of the Supreme Court declared the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia as an extremist organization, and shut it down, along with 395 religious organizations."
- Theodora Bakoyannis and Liliane Maury Pasquier are members of the PACE Monitoring Committee for the Russian Federation.
Disrespecting Russia's religious freedom is another non-negotiable violation by Moscow against the OSCE commitments.
Devotees should never be threatened with harassment, fines, or imprisonment for practicing their faith in a normal manner.
The court order to seize the assets of the organization belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses is adding to the pain.
I hope that this case will be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.
- Senator Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Committee on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The decision made yesterday by the Russian Supreme Court to ban the activities of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center in Russia on grounds of 'extremism' could lead to criminal prosecution against the members.
Like any other religion, Jehovah's Witnesses must be able to freely enjoy the right to peaceful assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation and by international commitments.
I am very concerned about the unnecessary criminalization of the peaceful activities of members of the Jehovah's Witnesses community in Russia, which is causing this community to no longer be able to exist in the country.
The decision of this Supreme Court poses a threat to the values and principles on which democratic, free, open, diverse, and harmonious societies are based.
- Michael Georg Link, Director of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
This ban targets the killing of peaceful individuals solely for clear religious actions that violate basic religious freedom rights and international human rights standards, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation.
Therefore, it needs to be modified immediately.
- Professor Ingeborg Gabriel, Personal Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Discrimination.
I feel alarmed by the decision of the Russian Supreme Court to recognize the members of the Jehovah's Witnesses as 'extremists'.
This decision makes the peaceful worship of 175,000 Russian citizens a criminal offense and violates the freedom of religion rights enshrined in the Russian Constitution.
The United Kingdom calls on the Russian government to adhere to international commitments on this fundamental freedom.
- Baroness Joyce Anelay, former Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the United Nations at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
On July 20, 2017, the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) adopted a statement from the European Union (EU).
The statement calls on Russia to allow Jehovah's Witnesses to "peacefully enjoy the right to freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation Constitution and international commitments."
This declaration has been unanimously adopted by all 28 member countries of the European Union in Vienna, and non-member countries of the European Union such as Australia, Canada, and Norway have also agreed to it.
Followers of the Almighty God worldwide are very disappointed by the arbitrary decision of the Russian Supreme Court effectively banning their religion nationwide.
In their reactions, international government agencies and officials have exposed Russia for unfairly declaring that Jehovah's Witnesses are "extremists" and have disregarded constitutional commitments.
The European Court of Human Rights has not yet considered this issue and hopes to overturn the nationwide ban.
Starting today, the practice of providing lifetime employment for public servants has been abolished.
The amended Law on Cadres and Civil Servants and the amended Law on State Cadres will come into effect from today, July 1, with a policy of indefinite recruitment for state officials.
According to the amended law, civil servants recruited today, July 1st, will sign a fixed-term labor contract instead of an indefinite-term contract as before.
Báo Thanh Niên reported that the term of the labor contract has been extended to five years, an increase of two years compared to the previous term.
In addition, according to the amended laws, the signing of indefinite labor contracts will still be maintained for those who were employed before July 1, 2020, and for officials who are transferred to new positions.
For public employees recruited before July 1st but have not signed an indefinite contract, they have the right to sign a fixed-term contract after completing the contract as stipulated by the law.
To ensure the benefits for public employees who sign fixed-term labor contracts, the amended laws also stipulate that the leaders of state units or organizations must provide...
The documentary film soundtrack by pop prince V has entered the global music charts.
The documentary film soundtrack of pop star Son Tung has topped the iTunes chart in Vietnam and has entered the top 10 in some other countries after its domestic release.
The song "Sky Tour" is currently at the 83rd position on the international iTunes chart at the beginning of this week.
The original soundtrack (OST) of the documentary about the pop star is ranked #5 on iTunes in the Czech Republic, #6 in Singapore, and #10 in Australia.
"SKY TOUR Movie" includes eight songs performed by Son Tung at live shows in Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City last year, and was released simultaneously with the movie.
At the age of 26, Son Tung has had a series of hit songs along with numerous awards, including an MTV Europe Music Award and being included in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in Vietnam in 2018.
His music videos attract millions of views due to their high-quality visuals and artistic content.
His latest music video with Snoop Dogg has just reached 100 million views on YouTube.
Asian newspapers have praised him for achieving this feat.
Newspapers in South Korea, the home country of the world-famous K-pop star, such as CcDailyNews, Stardailynews, and Sportsseoul, have called him "Vietnam's number one artist."
The dismantling of the Binh Trieu toll booth in Saigon has been completed.
On the afternoon of Monday, November 2nd, the authorities of Ho Chi Minh City completed the dismantling of toll booths at Binh Trieu 1 and Binh Trieu 2 bridges in Thu Duc district. These toll booths had been inactive for four years.
The Ho Chi Minh City Infrastructure Investment Company, the investor of the Binh Trieu Bridge project - phase 1 under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, put the toll gate into operation in 2005.
The company has maintained the toll booths instead of removing them because they plan to use them for the Binh Trieu Bridge project - phase 2.
However, the city government decided to temporarily suspend the Binh Trieu Bridge project - phase 2 in 2017, so the toll booths have not been operational since then.
The inactive toll booths have been identified as one of the causes of traffic congestion in the city, especially during peak hours.
Accidents have occurred due to drivers losing focus and crashing into toll booths.
According to the proposal of the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Transport, in July 2020, the Road Management Center was tasked with removing toll booths to reduce traffic congestion in the area.
15 Chinese and Vietnamese sailors went missing after a Panama-flagged ship sank near the central coast.
Rescue teams are searching for 15 Chinese and Vietnamese sailors on a Panama-flagged ship that sank off the coast of Binh Thuan province today, December 17th.
The ship carrying soil from Malaysia to Hong Kong was in the Binh Thuan sea area at 4:30 pm when the captain contacted the border forces of Phu Quy Island to report that the ship was tilting due to uneven distribution of soil towards one side.
Fifteen crew members - 11 Chinese and 4 Vietnamese - have boarded the ship.
But when the ship was about 1.5 nautical miles away from Phu Quy port, it suddenly tilted heavily and sank.
The emergency signal for rescue has been continuously broadcasted from that point.
The border defense forces of Binh Thuan and the rescue station in Phu Quy have dispatched a ship to the scene to rescue the crew members.
But no one was found until 6:30 p.m.
Despite the rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is still ongoing.
The search radius has been expanded to three to five nautical miles from the accident site, and additional ships have been deployed.
There seem to be myths and superstitions about almost every aspect of life, including physical characteristics.
The marks, such as moles, were considered evidence of guilt in the witch trials in Salem.
And among the Chinese people, the shape of your nose is believed to reveal whether you are wealthy or not.
There are also a series of fascinating legends about our current theme: scars.
The appearance of traces is not a rare phenomenon.
In fact, about 80% of us are born with seemingly random marks on our bodies.
There are many different types of moles.
In addition to biological marks such as brown moles and café au lait spots, there are also red blood vessels ranging from small pink spots, flat against the skin, to dark red swollen types.
These red features (veins) are caused by blood vessels located near the skin surface and visible through the skin.
Although we know that blood vessel blockages cause freckles, we do not know why this happens in the first place.
And this is the place where all the legends, mysteries, and mystical beliefs and attractions appear.
First on the list is the impressive legend of the mother.
This theory suggests that if a woman experiences a particularly strong emotion during pregnancy, her baby may be born with a scar.
Moreover, if a woman touches a specific spot on her body while experiencing emotions, that is where a mole will appear on the baby's body.
The legend of the Iranians believes that if a woman touches her belly while watching a solar eclipse, her baby may have a birthmark - you guessed it right.
Other legends focus on the color of food.
For example, if a baby has a red birthmark, it is believed that it is because the mother craved strawberries during pregnancy.
But if she wants to eat candied fruits or beets, her baby will have a port wine stain.
The chocolate cravings, meanwhile, seem to result in light milk chocolate brown spots.
In addition to being the result of the desire for pregnancy and looking at events like eclipses, the scars from childbirth are also considered signs of everyone's life.
For example, if you have a freckle on your right arm, you will surely prosper; but if it is on your left arm, you will have to save some coins.
Elsewhere, a mole on the left foot signifies that the person will be very intelligent, while if it is on the right foot, they will love exploration, adventure, and travel.
Some scars from birth are also believed to be related to how you died in a past life.
Is that scary?
Whether you believe in these myths and beliefs or not, they are certainly interesting to explore - and may even be beneficial.
Writing a story about your death and rebirth is sure to be an interesting topic for discussion at dinner parties.
Alternatively, you can explain the presence of a specific mark by suggesting that your mother wanted to touch a goat with her little toe while she was pregnant with you.

Vietnamese authorities have arrested, interrogated, and even tortured Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers who have returned to Vietnam from camps run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The government is violating an agreement with UNHCR, the organization tasked with monitoring the return of refugees and ensuring their safety.
Based on eyewitness testimonies and publicly available sources of information, the 55-page report "Nowhere to Hide: Ongoing Threats to Montagnard Indigenous People in the Central Highlands of Vietnam" highlights the continued challenges faced by the Montagnard people in the region.
"The Vietnamese government continues to hunt down Montagnard people even after they are out of sight of international observers," stated Brad Adams, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch.
"The international community should oppose forcing them to return to the Central Highlands of Vietnam unless the government continues to subject them to abuse."
The World Human Rights Organization has called on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to consider participating in encouraging and supporting voluntary return, due to alarming information about the situation.
It also calls on the US government to continue keeping Vietnam on the list of "Countries of Particular Concern" for violations of religious freedom, and encourages Cambodia to continue providing temporary shelter for
Vietnamese officials continue to pressure Christian Montagnards to sign commitments to renounce their religion, despite new regulations issued last year banning such actions.
Authorities in some areas restrict freedom of movement between villages, especially for unauthorized religious purposes, and prohibit Christian gatherings in many areas unless they are authorized by the government.
More worryingly, the Vietnamese government continues to impose criminal penalties on peaceful protests, unapproved religious activities, and efforts to seek refuge in Cambodia.
The group that is treated most harshly is those who follow the Christian faith in independent or unregistered churches, and those who support non-violent movements to protect and tightly control ancestral lands.
More than 350 Montagnard people have been sentenced to prison since 2001, mainly for political or peaceful religious activities.
Most have been convicted under Vietnam's Penal Code for vaguely defined national security crimes. This includes "undermining solidarity policies," "disturbing security," and "causing s
More than 60 Montagnard people have been detained after being forcibly deported from Cambodia, where they were seeking refuge.
The arrests continue to take place: in 2005 alone, at least 142 people - some of whom had been detained before trial for about a year - were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.
This is double the number of people detained compared to last year.
At least 30 people who were convicted in 2005 have been arrested in Cambodia or near border areas.
They were arrested by Cambodian police and handed over to Vietnamese police without any opportunity to apply for asylum with UNHCR.
The report includes an appendix listing the prisoners in the Central Highlands.
Adams said: "Serious issues continue to persist for the Montagnard people, and the Vietnamese government still conceals them."
For those who think that all the issues are over, they should rethink.
The report includes concerning testimonies from Montagnard individuals who returned to Vietnam in 2005 from UN refugee camps in Cambodia, but later "returned" to Cambodia after experiencing harsh treatment.
They described in detail being detained, interrogated, and even tortured upon returning to Vietnam.
They also talked about being forced to withdraw their beliefs and being threatened not to report any abuses to international delegations and UN monitors.
However, UNHCR has made public statements reiterating that returnees do not face "any specific threats or pressures," and that they "do not have any serious concerns n
Human Rights Watch has called on the Vietnamese government to allow UNHCR full and unrestricted access to the Central Highlands region, as well as to organize private and confidential meetings with local residents and NGOs.
The government also needs to ensure that there is no retaliation against the individuals that UNHCR meets or their families.
"These eyewitness accounts clearly demonstrate that some individuals have been subjected to torture and persecution for their religious and political beliefs," Adams said.
We have provided this information to UNHCR.
But this still continues to return people without unrestricted and confidential access to those returning that it needs to protect them properly.
The returnees were interviewed by the Human Rights Organization, which provided accurate information about the threats and serious threats from the Vietnamese authorities prior to the visits of the houses.
The returnees have been warned not to say anything negative to UNHCR officials.
A person who has returned, who was beaten and forced to abandon their religion in police custody, told the Human Rights Organization: "The United Nations asks about any abuse, but I
I told them that I was not beaten or threatened.
I dare not tell them that I have been sent to prison, if I do, they will beat me.
"Adams stated that monitoring cannot take place in front of Vietnamese officials, or when villagers are threatened and cannot speak."
The monitoring tasks of UNHCR and the resettlement program are currently experiencing many serious errors and need to be reconsidered.
These testimonies, presented to UNHCR in January 2006, challenge the credibility of monitoring returnees and assumptions based on related reintegration memoranda.
More and more foreign manufacturers are shifting their production to Vietnam amid the pandemic: JLL
With the new coronavirus pandemic and trade tensions pushing for the relocation of production lines from China to Southeast Asia, Vietnam, in particular, seems to have become an attractive destination for investors and manufacturers.
In a recent statement, a real estate consulting company stated that multinational manufacturers have been operating in Vietnam for many years and this trend is gaining momentum.
This movement has accelerated over the past 12-24 months as companies are seeking to diversify their operations and supply chains due to tariffs imposed on goods exported from China to the United States.
Stephen Wyatt, Head of JLL Vietnam, noted that Vietnam remains a promising market, with a growing trend in recent years of manufacturing companies looking to establish operations in the country.
The industrial park developer remains confident that the demand for land will continue to increase, and therefore, land prices are expected to rise, in line with the long-term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, Wyatt said.
Companies looking to diversify their manufacturing portfolios outside of China are increasingly attracted to Vietnam, thanks to its proximity to China, free trade agreements, and the government's development plans.
The report also notes that the average price of land in Northern Vietnam has reached $99 US dollars per square meter per lease term, an increase of 6.5% compared to the same period last year in the first quarter of 2021.
Meanwhile, the figure for the Southern region is 101 US dollars, an increase of 12.2% compared to the same period last year, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition, the factories that have been built have recorded an average price ranging from 3.5 to 5 US dollars per square meter per month in both areas.
The Vietnamese man cheated and sent his employee to quarantine in his place.
A businessman on the same flight from Hanoi to Hue with Vietnam's 30th Covid-19 patient has sent a replacement employee for quarantine.
The replacement was only discovered the next morning, said Mr. Hoang Nam, Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of Quang Tri province, on Monday.
Nam said that he flew on the same flight with 'patient number 30' from Hanoi to Hue.
The unnamed man is the director of a company investing in a wind energy project in Trung Trị province.
After learning about the replacement, the authorities requested the man to undergo self-isolation.
He is currently in isolation at the Lung and Respiratory Specialist Hospital in Dong Ha Town, province.
At 9:30 PM on Friday, four men checked into a hotel in Huong Hoa District, located 65 km west of the center of Dong Ha.
They have been identified as passengers on flight VN1547 from Hanoi to Thua Thien Hue, the 30th Covid-19 case in Vietnam.
The men were placed in quarantine on Sunday.
The authorities only found out about the substitution the next morning.
The authorities in Huong Hoa district are monitoring and searching for the individuals that these men have come into contact with in order to quarantine them.
They will also proceed to disinfect the places where suspected individuals have been.
Netherlands has invented a wifi router with record-breaking speed.
Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands have successfully developed a new device that allows for wifi transmission speeds over 300 times faster than conventional devices.
This device is expected to bring a new way of using wifi Internet.
According to researchers, the new wifi routing system operates based on the principle of the internet and will be distributed using 'light antennas'.
The 'light antenna' column is responsible for dividing each wavelength of the laser machine into separate fibers, each fiber can turn infrared rays into wifi internet.
Professor Ton Koonen from the Faculty of Science stated that the research group is studying using light beams to transmit wifi internet.
Ten years ago today, on June 10, 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the Russian government agencies had committed serious violations of human rights.
The decision of the ECHR requires Russia to pay a large sum of money and to restore the registration of the Local Religious Organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow - which government authorities had revoked in 2004.
The day after the verdict was announced, Mr. Ivan Chaykovskiy, the president of the Witness of Jehovah community in Moscow, said: "This verdict is a victory for justice and common empathy in the face of intolerance towards religion."
I hope that with this decision, the authorities will quickly restore our legal rights and end the nationwide harassment campaign conducted by the state against the believers.
However, that optimism quickly disappeared when the Russian authorities not only failed to comply with the provisions of the ECHR decision but also escalated their campaign to suppress our people across the federation.
This imposition was dramatically demonstrated when the Russian Supreme Court banned all peaceful religious activities of ours in 2017, an injustice that has been followed by a series of cases.
Despite being ten years old, many parts of the court's harsh verdict against Nga are still relevant.
In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights clearly rejected many unfounded allegations that Russia continues to make against our peaceful believers today.
In general, the ECHR concluded that the Moscow Ministry of Justice, along with the Moscow courts, had 'lacked a legal basis' when refusing to re-register the Jehovah's Witnesses. The court condemned the Moscow authorities,
In addition, the Moscow government authorities have also violated the European Convention on Human Rights, of which Russia is a party.
In 2020, just like in 2010, Russia's systematic campaign against our brothers cannot be ignored.
"For Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, practicing their faith means putting themselves at risk of losing their freedom," said Rachel Denber, Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch.
In a statement on January 9, 2020, she added: 'There is no reason that can prove this.'
In the face of injustice, we pray with absolute faith that Jehovah will continue to strengthen our brothers and sisters in Russia to 'endure fully with patience and joy.'
19 people returning from abroad have caused the number of Covid-19 infections in Vietnam to rise to 233.
Vietnam has confirmed six more cases of Covid-19 early on Friday morning, including five cases from overseas and one case related to Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.
"Patient 231," 57 years old, is an employee of Truong Sinh Company, a food and logistics provider for Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, currently the largest Covid-19 outbreak in the country.
She is a native of Bac Kan, living in Kim Ngu commune, Na Ri district.
On March 31st, she participated in a business trip with a group at Bach Mai Hospital to the nearby province of Ha Nam.
After learning about the cases of infection at Bach Mai Hospital, the healthcare sector in Ha Nam province has isolated the members of this team.
After testing positive for Covid-19, she was admitted to Ha Nam General Hospital for treatment.
She reported that the number of patients related to Bach Mai Hospital is 43, including 27 employees of Truong Sinh Company.
The remaining five patients are those who were isolated immediately after entering the country from abroad.
Patients 228, 229, and 230 returned to Vietnam on March 20th and were quarantined in Bac Ninh province.
More details about their flight home have not been disclosed yet.
"Patient 228" is a 29-year-old man from Bac Giang province who is currently being treated at a medical center in Ninh Thang commune, Hoa Lu district, Ninh Binh province.
"Patient 229" and "Patient 230," both women aged 30 and 28 respectively, come from the central province of Ha Tinh and have been admitted to Ninh Binh General Hospital for treatment.
Patients "232" and "233" returned to Vietnam on March 27 on Aeroflot flight SU290 from Moscow and have been quarantined in Bac Vinh Phuc province.
They are being treated at the Central Tropical Hospital in Dong Anh district, Hanoi.
"Patient 232" is a 67-year-old man from the southern province of Ba Ria - Vung Tau, and "Patient 233" is a 24-year-old woman from the central province of Nghe An in Vietnam.
Out of the 233 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Vietnam up to now, 75 cases have been discharged from the hospital.
On Wednesday afternoon, Vietnam declared Covid-19 a national epidemic.
So far, the Covid-19 pandemic has claimed nearly 53,000 lives in 204 countries and territories.
Anyone coming from any area that has experienced the Covid-19 pandemic will not be allowed to enter Vietnam, the Prime Minister directed on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to implement new policies towards South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, and all other countries and territories that have reported cases of Covid-19 infection caused by the new coronavirus.
Vietnam has achieved positive results in the fight against Covid-19, but the disease has entered the next phase, spreading to many places around the world and is currently developing in a complex and unpredictable manner.
For those who need to enter Vietnam for state work or special reasons, the government requires them to comply with the national health declaration process and to self-isolate for 14 days.
Citizens from countries affected by Covid-19, but coming from cities/provinces without outbreaks, will have to submit health declarations and comply with other necessary procedures when entering Vietnam.
Vietnamese citizens from areas affected by the outbreak in China can return home, but only through international border gates and will have to undergo a two-week quarantine upon entry, continuing the current policy.
As for our part, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on all Vietnamese citizens not to travel to affected areas, and if travel cannot be avoided, they must quarantine upon return.
Vietnamese people living in areas affected by the epidemic should strictly adhere to the regulations and guidelines of local authorities; and are advised not to return to Vietnam at this time.
Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam said on Tuesday morning that in order to achieve positive results like today, Vietnam has actively implemented measures to prevent and control the disease since mid-December.
Starting from February 1st, Vietnam has temporarily suspended all flights to and from China and stopped issuing tourist visas to Chinese nationals from affected areas.
After South Korea raised its disease alert to the 'highest level', the Vietnamese government has strengthened control over tourists from that country.
Starting from Monday, people arriving from South Korea must declare their health status, and those with symptoms such as high fever, cough, and difficulty breathing will be placed in quarantine for at least 14 days.
All flights from disease-affected areas in South Korea will be redirected to smaller airports - Van Don in Quang Ninh province in the north, Phu Cat in Binh Dinh province in the central region, and Can Tho in the Mekong Delta.
Currently, Saigon and Da Nang are quarantining 83 people who arrived on Monday from the city of Daegu in South Korea, where a major outbreak of the coronavirus has been detected.
Some South Koreans refused to be quarantined and flew back home on Tuesday evening.
South Korea is attracting international attention as one of the countries and territories most severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with 977 confirmed cases reported as of Tuesday evening, ranking second only to China.
By Tuesday, all 16 new cases of coronavirus infection discovered in Vietnam have fully recovered.
In the past 13 days, no new infections have been reported in the country.
The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting 39 countries and territories.
The death toll has surpassed 2,700, mainly in China, followed by Iran with 15 people, South Korea with 11, and Italy with seven people.
The flood caused the death of athletes participating in the Dalat Ultra Trail 2020 competition.
An athlete participating in the 2020 Ultra Trail international marathon, held in the highland city of Da Lat, was found dead this afternoon, June 20, after being swept away by floods caused by heavy rain.
The victim, identified as Thai Don Thanh, was running through a part of the Golden Stream in Da Sal commune, Lac Duong district when the 40-year-old resident of Ho Chi Minh City had an accident, Saigon Giai Phong news reported.
The Lac Duong District government informed Tuoi Tre Online that due to heavy rain on the same day, the floodwater level suddenly rose while athletes were competing in the rain.
After the accident occurred, the marathon organizers temporarily suspended the race and used vehicles to transport the athletes back to the starting point.
More than 6,200 local and international athletes participated in the Dalat Ultra Trail 2020 mountain race.
Japan is currently testing a robot that cooks soba noodles at Tokyo station.
That is the startup company JR East Co., Ltd., which recently conducted an experiment on a soba noodle cooking robot for train passengers at a Tokyo station.
The robot is placed at Higashi-Koganei station on the Chuo Railway line, with the ability to make 40 soba dishes per hour, equivalent to the efficiency of a chef.
The robot is responsible for cooking noodles while the staff is responsible for placing them on plates and serving them to customers.
Based on information from the East Japan Railway Company, the testing period may be extended until April 15 with the goal of determining whether the robot operates well enough and meets customer expectations.
According to an employee, thanks to the robot, it is possible to avoid both the hot temperatures in the kitchen during the summer and the risk of being scalded by boiling water from noodles.
In addition, while the robot is boiling noodles, the chef will have time to do something else, such as working with customers, cooking fried dishes, and cleaning up utensils.
Imagine a plane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the Earth every 25 seconds while counting each blade of grass.
Shrink it all down to fit in the palm of your hand, and you'll have something equivalent to a modern hard drive, an item capable of storing more information than perhaps even your local library.
So how does it store so much information in such a small space?
At the heart of every hard drive is a cluster of high-speed rotating disks with a recording head flying over each surface.
Each disk is coated with a film containing small magnetic metal particles, and your data does not exist there in a form that you can recognize.
Instead, it is recorded in the form of a magnetic pattern formed by those small particle groups.
In each group, also known as a bit, all particles have their magnetic orientation aligned in one of two possible states, corresponding to zero and one.
Data is written to disk by converting a string of bits into an electric current passing through a coil.
This magnet generates a force strong enough to change the magnetic orientation of metal particles.
When this information is written onto the disk, the drive uses a magnetic read head to convert it back into a useful form, similar to how a phonograph needle converts the grooves on a vinyl record into music.
But how can you get a lot of information from just zeros and ones?
By placing them together multiple times.
For example, a character is represented by one byte, or eight bits, and an average picture of yours takes up a number of megabytes, with each megabyte equivalent to 8 million bits.
Because each bit must be written to a physical area of the disk, we always try to increase the areal density of the disk, or the number of bits that can be compressed into one square inch.
The areal density of modern hard drives is about 600 gigabits per square inch, over 300 million times higher than IBM's first hard drive from 1957.
This breakthrough in storage capacity is not just about making everything smaller, but also involves many innovations.
A technique called thin film lithography process allows engineers to shrink the read and write heads.
And although small in size, readers become more sensitive by utilizing new discoveries about the magnetic and quantum properties of matter.
Bits can also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that eliminate noise from magnetic interactions, and find the highest probability bit sequence from each read signal part.
Controlling the thermal expansion of the read head, by placing a heater below the magnetic tip, allows it to fly within 5 nanometers of the disk surface, equivalent to the width of two DNA strands.
In the past few decades, the sharp growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore's Law, predicted in 1975 that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double approximately every two years.
But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, the stretching of magnetic particles or bringing them closer together poses a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect.
When the volume of the particle gradually decreases to a very small size, its magnetic field is easily affected by temperature and may unintentionally cause the bits to change, leading to data loss.
Scientists have solved this limitation in an amazing way by changing the direction of recording from vertical to perpendicular, allowing the data density to reach up to a terabit per square inch.
Recently, the potential limit has been increased once again through recording from thermal and magnetic support.
This uses a more stable recording medium, its magnetic resistance is temporarily reduced by heating a specific point with a laser and allowing data to be recorded.
And while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists have come up with another potential trick: the bit template medium, where the bit positions are arranged in unique structures.
It is thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this incredibly powerful and precise tool can fit in the palm of your hand.
Few people know, but these six creatures are about to undergo a very unusual death.
A carnivorous plant.
There are over 600 plant species worldwide that supplement their normal diet of sunlight, water, and soil by eating insects, bacteria, or even frogs and mice.
Scientists believe that carnivory in plants has evolved independently at least six times on our planet, implying that this carnivorous adaptation provides significant benefits to the plants.
Carnivorous plants often grow in areas with high acidity, lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
In such harsh conditions, plant species with the ability to attract, capture, and consume prey will have an advantage over those that rely on the soil to provide nutrients.
Think of this unfriendly swamp, where carnivorous plants reign supreme.
Attracted by the bright colors and enticing scent of the container, the fly moves closer and sips its nectar.
But this plant contains a substance called coniine in its nectar, a powerful drug for insects.
When coniine takes effect, the fly becomes slow, stumbles, and falls into a tube leading to a liquid-filled container at the bottom, where it drowns.
Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid gradually break down their bodies into micro particles that plant roots can absorb through their leaves.
Sometimes, even big prey falls into the trap of the flower tube.
The second victim faced a vine.
The small leaves of the sundew plant are equipped with a sticky substance called mucilage.
The ant quickly got stuck in this sticky substance.
When she struggles, enzymes begin to digest her body.
The special feet sensed her movements and twisted around her, tightly gripping her in their suffocating embrace.
When she is suffocating, this can happen in less than an hour, the tentacles of the jellyfish species open up to catch their next victim.
Two are done, four more to go.
The next goal leads to an outcome beneath the ground, within the twist of a corkscrew tree.
He went into the roots through a small gap to find food.
But inside, he quickly got lost in the intricate maze.
A forest of curly hair blocked his escape, leading him into a central room with meat-digesting enzymes and dangerously low levels of oxygen.
In the dark depths of a nearby pond, a young frog unknowingly swam into the path of the Venus flytrap, the fastest meat-eating plant species.
She stepped onto the water trap of the water vine, and in just milliseconds, the trap door swung open and sucked her inside.
Trapped halfway inside and halfway outside, she struggles to escape while the part of her body inside the tree is being digested.
In the next few hours, her struggles activated the continuous network structure, pulling her deeper into the tree to be slowly digested alive.
Meanwhile, this beetle is attracted by the sweet smell of honey.
The scent drew him closer and closer until he landed on the leaf of the world's most famous flesh-eating plant.
His landing excited the tiny hairs on the surface of the leaf, and the plant's snapping tongue teeth closed around him.
The locks were intertwined to seal his fate.
When closed, the leaf acts as a stomach outside, digesting the soft tissues of the insect.
When they reopened a few days later, only the dry husk of his exoskeleton remained.
The grasshopper is the last surviving creature.
As she approached the butterwort plant, she noticed the tall, delicate flowers blooming above the sticky leaves of the plant.
She landed on the petals, drank the nectar, and flew away without any harm.
These long flower branches keep some types of insects from accessing the traps of carnivorous plants - a way to distinguish herbivory from feeding.
The bamboo dragonfly flies to have a long and meaningful life - oh.
In my free time outside of Twitter, I experimented a bit with online storytelling, testing what we can do with new digital tools.
And in my work at Twitter, I have actually spent some time working with authors and storytellers, helping to expand the boundaries of what people are experimenting with.
And today, I want to discuss some examples of things that people have done that I find very interesting, using flexible and anonymous identities on the web and blurring the boundaries between reality and fiction.
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
Before the social network Twitter existed, radio stations brought us broadcasting programs and connected millions of people to unique broadcasting points.
And from those points, stories emerge.
Some of them are familiar stories.
Some of them are new stories.
And some time later, they became familiar with certain formats, but then the radio station began to develop a unique format specifically for that medium.
Think about the series of movies that have been broadcast live on the radio.
Combining live performance with serialized storytelling, you will have this new format.
And the reason why I mention the radio station is because I think the radio station is a great example of how a new media defines new formats and thereby defines stories.
And of course, nowadays we have a completely new way to play, which is this online world.
This is a map of verified Twitter users and their relationships.
There are thousands and thousands of them.
Each point in this set is a separate broadcasting station.
We have entered a world where people can connect with each other flexibly, where accessing tools is the only barrier to communication.
And I think we should start seeing completely new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
I truly believe that we are in a vast border for creative experimentation, if you will, that we have explored and begun to exploit the wild lands of the Internet and are now just preparing to catch
I believe this starts from the evolution of existing methods.
For example, people are saying that short stories are experiencing a revival thanks to e-readers and digital marketplaces.
An author, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing a very short story called "Wool".
And he really said that he had no intention of "Wool" becoming a series, but the audience loved the first story so much that they demanded more, so he provided more for them.
I gave them "Wool 2," which is a bit longer than the first book, "Wool 3," even longer, and "Wool 5," a novel that is 60,000 words long.
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had a quick feedback system for e-books.
He is able to write and publish relatively quickly.
There is no intermediary between him and the audience.
He simply connects directly with his audience and grows based on the feedback and enthusiasm they give him.
Therefore, this whole project is an experiment.
Everything starts with a short story, and I think experimentation has truly become a part of Howey's format.
And that is what this tool has allowed, which is the experimentation to become a part of the main format.
This is a short story by author Jennifer Egan titled "Black Box."
It was originally written specifically for Twitter.
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account so that they could tweet all the lines she created.
Currently, Twitter has a limit of 140 characters.
Egan simply wrote by hand on this script notebook, using the limited space of the script boxes to write each individual tweet, and those tweets have turned into over 600 tweets that The New Yorker published as a section.
Every night at 8 pm, you can watch a short story from The New Yorker's comic account.
I think that is truly interesting: music - in literary novels.
Experiencing Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there are many different ways to experience it.
You can scroll back to read again, but what's interesting is that if you're watching live, there's a tension created by the real-time tweets, you can't control when you'll read them.
The articles come quite regularly, but as the story unfolds, typically, as the reader, you would control the reading speed of the text, but in this case, The New Yorker magazine is the one making the decision.
Another excellent example of fiction and short stories on Twitter is Elliott Holt, an author who has written a story titled "Evidence."
Starting from a tweet like this: "At 10:13 pm on November 28th, a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44 years old, from Brooklyn, fell from the roof of a hotel in Manhattan."
It starts with Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice falls silent, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot, and Simon, the characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives.
When this woman falls down and dies.
These three characters have brought a realistic perspective from various angles.
A reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right" because she did just that.
She recorded that voice and she has many characters, all of which take place in real time.
Interesting fact is that Twitter is not the only distribution mechanism.
It is also like Twitter as a production mechanism.
Elliott later told me that she wrote all of that with her thumb.
She is lying on the couch and constantly switching between different characters while tweeting each line.
I think that natural creativity, such as creating what is being conveyed through the voices of real characters, brings authenticity to those characters, as well as to the format itself.
When you start playing with an online flexible identity, the more interesting thing is when you start interacting with the real world.
Things like Invisible Obama or the "binders full of women" story emerged during the 2012 election cycle, or even the "West Wing" fan fiction universe on Twitter where you have accounts for each character in "The West Wing," including
(Laughing) Everything is just quick versions of a theme.
They are creative individuals experimenting with the limits of what is possible in this medium.
You can see examples like the Twitter account of "West Wing," where you see fictional characters interacting with the real world.
They comment on politics, they raise their voices against the evils of the National Assembly.
Remember, they are all members of the Democratic Party.
And they interact with the real world.
They react to that.
When you use a flexible identity, anonymity, interact with the real world, and go beyond simple praise or ridicule, and you start using these tools to tell a story, that's when everything comes together.
In the Chicago mayoral election, there was a satirical candidate.
That is Mayor Emanuel.
It provides you with everything you want from Rahm Emanuel, especially in the field of profanity.
This account contains vulgar language and tracks the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it unfolds.
It pursues all the natural structures of a good and solid fake Twitter account, but then starts to become bizarre.
And as the story continues to develop, it transitions from this commentary into an extended science fiction narrative spanning several weeks in real time, in which your main character, Rahm Emanuel, embarks on interstellar journeys.
I have checked the newspaper again.
And then, interestingly, it ends.
This usually doesn't happen with a sarcastic Twitter account.
End, a real conclusion to the story.
And that's why the author Dan Sinker, a journalist who has completely hidden his identity all this time, I think Dan - it makes perfect sense when he decides to turn this into a book, because it has become m
One of my favorite examples of what is happening on Twitter right now, truly, is the Crimer Show program that fits very well with the absurdist trend.
Crimer Show tells the story of a super criminal and a clumsy detective facing off in this extremely bizarre language, with all the elements of a TV show.
The creator of the Crimer Show program said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in England, but it is really hard to understand.
And there are times when Crimer, a top-notch criminal, carries out all those things on television.
He always takes off his glasses or turns away from the camera, but that only happens in the text.
I think borrowing all these TV show phrases and presenting each criminal program as an episode, abbreviated as E - P - P - A - S - O - D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes.
Every day on Twitter, there is a new "episode" of the Crimer Show program, and they are stored in that way.
And I think this is an interesting experiment about formatting.
Something completely new has been created here by mocking something on television.
I think that there are many excellent examples of real-time storytelling.
RealTimeWWII is an account that chronicles what happened on this day 60 years ago in detail, as if you are reading news reports from that day.
And the author Teju Cole has conducted many experiments to bring a literary twist to current events.
In this specific case, he is talking about drone attacks.
I think in both of these examples, you are beginning to see how storytelling with non-fiction content can be integrated into new forms of fictional storytelling.
By telling stories in real time, blurring the line between reality and fiction, the physical world and the digital world, being flexible and anonymous, these are all tools that we can access, and t
They are the small parts that we use to create structures, frameworks, and then become settlements on this vast open border region to experiment creatively.
You are exercising.
The first time feels easy, but each time you lift, it requires more effort until you can no longer continue.
In your arms, muscles are responsible for lifting and cannot contract.
Why are our bodies feeling tired?
We often blame lactic acid or energy depletion for muscle fatigue, but these factors alone are not enough to explain muscle fatigue.
There is another main motivation: the ability of muscles to react to signals from the brain.
To understand the cause of muscle fatigue, knowing how a muscle contracts when receiving a signal from the nervous system will be very helpful.
These signals move from the brain to the muscles in just a fraction of a second through long and thin cells called motor neurons.
Nerve cells and muscle cells are separated by a small gap, and the exchange of particles through this gap allows the muscle to contract.
On one side of the synaptic cleft, motor neurons contain a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
On the other side, the charged particles, or ions, are distributed along the muscle cell membrane: potassium inside and sodium outside.
In response to a signal from the brain, nerve cells in the body release acetylcholine, activating pores on muscle cell membranes to open up.
Sodium goes in, and potassium goes out.
The electrical charge of these particles is an important step in muscle contraction: changes in charge create an electrical signal called action potential that spreads through muscle cells, stimulating the release of calcium.
This calcium flow causes muscle contraction by activating hidden proteins within muscle fibers to lock together and pull towards each other, making the muscle tense up.
Energy is used to provide the contraction from a molecule called ATP.
ATP also helps pump ions back across the membrane, restoring the balance of sodium and potassium on both sides.
The entire process repeats every time the muscle contracts.
Whenever contraction occurs, energy in the form of ATP is used, waste products such as lactic acid are produced, and some ions drift out of the muscle cell membrane, leaving a smaller and smaller group behind.
Although muscle cells use ATP when they contract continuously, they always produce more than they use, so most of the time even when the muscles are tired, their energy source is not depleted.
And although many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain a normal pH level, indicating that fibers are effectively removing these waste products.
Finally, through the repeated process of muscle contraction, there may not be enough concentration of potassium, sodium, or calcium immediately near the muscle cell membrane to properly reset the system.
Therefore, even if the brain sends a signal, muscle cells will not be able to generate the necessary action potential to contract.
Even if ions such as sodium, potassium, or calcium are depleted in or around muscle cells, these ions are still abundant elsewhere in the body.
With a little time, they will return to the areas they need, sometimes with the help of sodium and potassium pumps.
Therefore, if you stop and rest, muscle fatigue will decrease as these ions are replenished in the muscles.
This is because the stronger you are, the fewer times the nerve signal cycle from the brain to the muscles needs to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight.
Fewer cycles mean slower ion depletion, so as your body improves, you can exercise longer at the same intensity.
Many muscles develop during training, and larger muscles also have more ATP and greater ability to remove waste, helping to prolong fatigue in the future.
Economists have been studying human behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value.
They have researched the infrastructure that supports our commercial activities, such as legal systems, corporations, and markets.
But there is a new technological infrastructure that will change the way we exchange value, and it is called blockchain.
This is truly a very strong statement, but if you don't remember anything else from this speech, I really want you to remember that while blockchain technology is still relatively new, it is also a continuation of.
As human beings, we try to reduce uncertainty about each other so that we can exchange value.
One of the first individuals to truly explore the idea of organizations as a tool in the economy to reduce uncertainty and facilitate transactions was Nobel Prize-winning economist Douglass North.
He passed away at the end of 2015, but North paved the way for what is known as the "new institutional economics".
And what he wants to say about the actual institutions are just formal rules like the constitution, and informal constraints, such as bribery.
These foundations are truly the grease that keeps our economic wheels turning, and we can see this happening through the history of mankind.
If we remember the time when we were hunters-gatherers, we actually only exchanged within the structure of our village.
We have established some unofficial limitations, but we have enforced all of our transactions through violence or social consequences.
As our society becomes more complex and our commercial routes become more distant, we have established more official institutions, such as banks to manage currency, primarily.
These organizations have helped us manage transactions when the uncertainty and complexity levels increased, and our individual control was much lower.
Finally, with the internet, we bring these educational foundations online.
We have built market platforms like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, only faster than physical infrastructure like brokers to support human economic activities.
According to Douglass North's perspective, institutions are a tool to reduce uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of values in society.
And I believe that we are now entering a next and powerful evolution in how we interact and transact, because for the first time, we can reduce uncertainty not only with organizations.
So what is blockchain?
Blockchain technology is a decentralized database storing a list of assets and transactions on a peer-to-peer network.
That is a public register of who owns what and who carries out transactions of what.
Transactions are secured through encryption, and over time, the transaction history is locked in data blocks that are then cryptographically linked and secured.
This creates an unchangeable, tamper-proof record of all transactions on this network.
This record is copied on each computer using the network.
That is not an application.
That is not a company.
I think it's close to the description on Wikipedia.
We can view all information on Wikipedia.
It is an overall view that is constantly changing and being updated.
We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia, and we can create our own wikis because essentially, they are just databases.
On Wikipedia, it is an open platform for storing text and images and the changes of that data over time.
On the blockchain, you can consider it as an open infrastructure for storing various types of assets.
It stores the history of management, ownership, and location for assets such as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, other digital assets like intellectual property ownership certificates.
It could be a certificate, a contract, physical objects, or even personally identifiable information.
Of course, there are other technical details about blockchain, but fundamentally, that's how it works.
That is a public ledger of transactions stored in a network and replicated multiple times to ensure security and resistance to tampering.
This brings me to the issue of how blockchain technology reduces uncertainty and thus promises to transform our economic system in a revolutionary way.
Uncertainty is a major term in the field of economics, but I want to go through its three forms that we encounter in most of our daily transactions, where blockchain can play a role.
We face uncertainty as if we don't know who we are dealing with, can't see the transaction clearly, and have no way to resolve things if they go wrong.
So let's look at the first example, we don't know who we are trading with.
I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay.
The first thing I will do is to learn about the seller.
Are they power users?
Do they have any good reviews and ratings, or do they not have any profiles at all?
Comments, rankings, check marks: these are the credentials of our identity that we gather today and use to reduce uncertainty about the people we are interacting with.
But the problem is that they are very scattered.
Please think about the number of profiles you currently have.
Blockchain technology allows us to create an open, global platform to store any certification about any individual from any source.
This allows us to create a mobile identity that users can control.
More than just a profile, it means you can choose to disclose different characteristics about yourself to facilitate transactions or interactions, such as the government issuing you an ID card, or you have...
Having this type of mobile identification in the physical and digital world means that we can carry out all kinds of human transactions in a completely new way.
Therefore, I have talked about how blockchains can reduce uncertainty in identifying the parties we are transacting with.
The second common uncertainty we often encounter is the lack of transparency in our interactions.
Please say that you will send me that smartphone by mail.
I want a level of transparency.
I want to know that the product I purchased is the same as the product sent in the mail and that there is a record of how it was delivered to me.
This is not only true for electronic devices like smartphones but also for many other types of goods and data, such as medicines, luxury items, any type of data or product that we do not want to be tampered with.
The issue in many companies, especially those manufacturing complex products like smartphones, is that they are managing multiple different suppliers on a horizontal supply chain.
All those involved in producing a product do not have the same database.
They do not use the same infrastructure, so tracking the development of a product over time becomes very difficult.
Using blockchain, we can create a shared reality among parties that do not trust each other.
This means that all nodes in the network do not need to know about each other or trust each other, as each node is capable of monitoring and verifying its own chain.
Remember to visit Wikipedia.
It is a shared database, and although many people read and write at the same time, it still only has one single truth.
We can create that using blockchain technology.
We can create a decentralized database with similar performance to a centralized one without the need to establish that central authority.
Therefore, all these providers, all types of companies, can interact using the same database without needing to trust each other.
This means that for consumers, we can have more transparency.
When an object in the real world moves, we can see its digital certificate or token moving on the blockchain, creating new value with each step.
This is a completely new world for our display.
Therefore, I have talked about how blockchain can reduce the uncertainty about our identities and how they change the meaning of transparency in long and complex transactions, such as in the supply chain.
The ultimate uncertainty that we often encounter is one of the most open things, which is uncertainty about breaking an appointment.
What if you don't send me the smartphone?
Can I get my money back?
Blockchain allows us to write code, bind contracts between individuals, and ensure that those contracts will be executed in reality without the need for a third party to enforce them.
Therefore, if we consider the example of a smartphone, you may think about using escrow services.
You are sponsoring that phone, but you don't need to disburse until you can verify that all conditions have been met.
You have a phone.
I think this is one of the most interesting ways that blockchains reduce our uncertainty, because it means we can reduce some of the organizations and agencies enforcing
This means that many economic activities of humans can be collateralized and automated, pushing many human interventions to the extreme, where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.
I think what might surprise Douglass North about the use of this technology is the fact that what makes it work, what keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our lack of trust.
Instead of letting all the uncertainties slow us down and requiring organizations like banks, governments, corporations, we can actually harness all that uncertainty and use it to our advantage.
Now, I don't want you to think that blockchain is the solution to every problem, even though the media has said that it will end world hunger and solve the tax issue.
The truth is, this technology is still in its early stages, so we will need to see many experiments take place and there may be failures before we truly understand all use cases for the economy.
But there are thousands of people working on this, from financial organizations to technology companies, startups, and universities.
And one of the reasons is that it is not just an economic evolution.
That is also an innovation in the field of computer science.
Blockchain technology provides us with the technical ability to create a record of human interactions, of currency exchanges, of all types of digital and physical assets, and even of unique characteristics.
Therefore, in some ways, they become a technology organization with many benefits over traditional organizations that we commonly use in society, but they do this in a decentralized manner.
It does this by turning a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.
Therefore, I think we need to start preparing ourselves, as we are about to face a world where distribution organizations and self-governance play a significant role.
(Hò reo) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.
I think I understand that it is coming, it brings a lot of potential and it is complex.
What is your estimated acceptance rate?
Bettina Warburg: I think that's a very good question.
My laboratory mainly focuses on developing applications for businesses and governments, because in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.
How many of you truly understand how the internet works?
But you use it every day, so I think we are facing the same idea as John Sculley about technology so we don't see or appreciate it, and blockchain is not that right now, so it's not.
BG: Thank you.
Thank you for coming to TED.
BW: Thank you.

What do these animals have in common?
More than you can imagine.
Along with over 5,000 other species, they are mammals, or members of the class Mammalia.
All mammals belong to the group with a backbone, meaning they have a backbone.
Mammals are distinguished from other vertebrate animals by a number of common characteristics.
This includes warm blood, fur or body hair, lung respiration, and feeding offspring with milk.
Despite these similarities, these creatures also have many biological differences, and one of the most notable is how they reproduce.
Let's start with the most familiar mammal larvae.
This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even blue whales, the largest animals on Earth.
Its base, a disc of richly vascularized tissue, attaches to the uterine wall to support the development of the fetus.
Directly connected to the mother's blood supply, it delivers nutrients and oxygen straight into the baby's body through the umbilical cord, and also removes waste products from the baby.
Mammals with wombs can stay inside the womb much longer than other animals.
For example, a blue whale calf takes nearly a year to develop inside its mother.
Umbilical cord keeps the calf alive until just before it is born, when the umbilical cord is severed and the respiratory, circulatory, and waste removal systems of the newborn calf take over.
A newborn animal with a length of about 23 feet is already able to swim.
In the next 6 months, it will drink 225 liters of concentrated, fatty milk from its mother every day.
Meanwhile, in Australia, you can find another type of mammal - the marsupial.
Marsupial babies have very small and delicate nipples when they are born, so they have to continue developing in their mother's pouch.
For example, the quoll is one of the smallest marsupials in the world, weighing only about 18 milligrams at birth, equivalent to about 30 grains of sugar.
The kangaroo rat, a marsupial, gives birth to a tiny baby the size of a soybean each time.
The baby crawls down between the mother's vagina, then has to climb up to the abdomen, where the baby will continue to breastfeed for the next 6 - 11 months.
Even after the kangaroo baby leaves this warm place, it will come back to suckle milk.
Sometimes, she is just one of the three babies that her mother is taking care of.
A female marsupial mouse can often be pregnant with one offspring in the uterus and another in the pouch at the same time.
When that happens, she can produce two different types of milk, one for the newborn, and one for the older kangaroo.
The word "mammalia" means of the breast, which is an inaccurate term because while kangaroos do indeed produce milk from mammary glands in their abdominal pouches, they do not actually have breasts.
They are not grass larvae either, for example, the third and perhaps the strangest in the mammalian reproductive process.
There used to be hundreds of monotreme species, but now only five species remain: four species of echidna and the platypus.
The name monotreme means a single hole, referring to the single opening they use for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying.
Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and other species, these animals lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
Their eggs have soft shells, and when their babies hatch, they suckle milk from pores on their mother's body until they are large enough to feed themselves.
Despite laying eggs and having other features that we typically associate with animals that are not mammals, such as webbed feet and bills of ducks, as well as spurs on the legs of males, ducks are actually.
This is because they share specific characteristics of mammals and have evolutionary connections with the rest of this animal class.
Whether they are mammals with wombs, marsupials, or egg-laying species, each species and their unique birthing methods, even though peculiar, have been successful for thousands of years in creating new life and diversity in the animal kingdom.
Dr. Fukanō, a strange scientist and famous explorer, has started a new challenge: flying around the world non-stop in an airplane he designed himself.
The ability to move steadily at an astonishing speed is an incredible feat of the Earth's rotational velocity, it would take an airplane six hours to circumnavigate the globe.
There is only one issue: the plane can only carry 180 kiloliters of fuel, enough to travel exactly half of the distance.
Please be honest.
The professor may have been able to design an airplane to hold more fuel, but where is the fun in that?
Instead, he proposed a slightly more complex solution: building three identical airplanes for the mission.
In addition to speed, the professor also equipped them with some other incredibly amazing features.
Each aircraft can quickly rotate and transfer any amount of fuel to another in mid-air without reducing speed, as long as they are side by side.
The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants, Fugōri and Orokana, will each pilot the remaining planes.
However, only one airport, located on the equator, allowed this experiment, turning it into the starting point, destination, and the only point where airplanes could land, take off, or refuel on the surface.
How can the three airplanes coordinate to ensure the professor can fly continuously throughout the journey and achieve his dream without running out of fuel and crashing?
Stop here if you want to explore on your own.
According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to do it with a little bit of luck.
The key is to maximize the support that each assistant provides, without wasting a drop of fuel.
It also helps us think symmetrically so that we can make shorter trips in both directions while also helping the professor prepare for an unsupported long stretch in the middle.
This is his solution.
All three airplanes took off at noon flying west, each plane fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.
After 45 minutes, or one-eighth of the way, each remaining plane has 135 kiloliters.
Orokana gave 45 to the professor and 45 to Fugōri, filling up fuel for both.
With 45 minutes left, Orokana returned to the airport and went to the waiting lounge to rest properly.
45 minutes later, with a quarter of the journey completed, both the professor and Fugōri were at 135 kiloliters.
Fugōri moved 45 into the professor's pool, leaving 90 for himself to return.
Professor Fukanō straightened up and played his favorite album.
He will be alone for a while.
At that moment, Orokana was eagerly awaiting the return of Fugōri, her plane had been refueled and was ready to take off.
As soon as his plane touched down, she took off, this time flying east.
At this point, exactly 180 minutes have passed and the professor is halfway through the journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel remaining.
In the next 90 minutes, the professor's and Orokana's planes fly towards each other and meet at a point three-quarters of the way along the route.
When the professor's fuel source was running low, he saw Orokana's airplane.
She gave him 45 kiloliters out of her remaining 90, so that they both have 45 kiloliters.
But that's only half of what they need to get to the airport.
Fortunately, at that moment, Fugōri, fully fueled, took off.
45 minutes later, when the other two planes were running out of fuel, he met them at a point heading 315 degrees and transferred 45 kiloliters of fuel to each plane, leaving 45 for himself.
All three planes landed at the airport as soon as their fuel levels reached zero.
When journalists and photographers cheered, the professor promised that his airplane would soon be available for commercial flights, right after they figured out how to prevent food on the plane from spilling everywhere.
Like many of you, I am one of the seven billion people on Earth living in a city.
And there are days - I don't know about the rest of you - but there are days when I truly feel dependent on others to some extent for most things in my life.
And sometimes, that can be a little scary.
But what I want to tell you today is that this dependency is actually a very powerful social infrastructure that we can use to help heal some issues.
A few years ago, I read an article by journalist Michael Pollan in The New York Times, in which he argued that growing even a portion of our food is one of the best things we can do.
When I read this, it was in the middle of winter and I definitely don't have much space in my New York apartment.
Therefore, I just want to read the next issue of Wired magazine and find out how experts will solve these problems for us in the future.
But that is exactly the point that Michael Pollan mentioned in this article - when we shift the responsibility of all these things to the experts, we create the kind of disorder that we see in the food system.
Yes, I am lucky to know a little about how NASA has used hydroponics to explore growing plants in space.
And you can truly achieve optimal nutritional efficiency by running a high-quality liquid soil through the plant's root system.
Now, for a plant, my apartment must certainly be a strange place like the outside space.
But I can provide some natural light and control the climate all year round.
Two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical aquaponic platforms for growing food indoors.
And the way it works is that there is a pump at the bottom, periodically pushing the nutrient solution up to the top, then dripping down through the root system of the plants suspended in clay pellets - so there is no soil involved.
Now the light and temperature vary depending on the small climate conditions of each window, so a window farm requires a farmer, and she must decide on the type of crops that she
At that time, a window farm was nothing more than a complex technical idea that required a lot of experimentation.
And I really want it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing fields in terms of patents in the United States today, and it could become another field like Monsanto, where...
Therefore, I decided that instead of creating a product, I will open the door for another group of programmers to join in the development together.
The first systems that we created, they functioned relatively well.
We can actually grow about one salad per week in a standard apartment window in New York City.
And we have successfully grown cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, among other things.
But those initial systems were energy-consuming, noisy, and leaky devices that Martha Stewart would surely never accept.
(Laughter) So, to attract more developers to join us, we have created a social networking site to upload designs, explain how they work, and we have even gone so far as to point out all.
And then, we invited people from all over the world to help build them and experiment with us.
Because of the current reality on this website, we have 18,000 people.
And we have indoor farms worldwide.
What we are doing is what NASA or a large corporation might call R&D, or research and development.
But what we call it is R&D - I - Y, or "research and development self-implemented."
(Smiling) For example, Jackson suggested that we use an air pump instead of a water pump.
It was necessary to build a series of new systems to do it right, but once we did, we were able to reduce carbon emissions by nearly half.
Tony in Chicago has participated in growing experiments, like many indoor farmers, and he has successfully managed to grow strawberries year-round under low light conditions by making adjustments.
And the farmers growing plants on windowsills in Finland have adjusted their plant-growing windows for the dark days of the Finnish winter by equipping them with LED grow lights that they are currently making for the public and as part of a project.
The window garden has evolved through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
And for each open-source project, the real benefit comes from the interaction between the specific concerns of those customizing their systems for their own interests, and the general concerns.
Therefore, my core team and I can focus on making real improvements that benefit everyone.
And we can take care of the needs of newcomers.
Therefore, for those who do it themselves, we provide free, thoroughly tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere in the world, can build m
And there is also a patent pending for these systems held by the community.
And to fund the project, we collaborate to create products that we then sell to schools and individuals who do not have the time to build their own systems.
Now in our community, a specific culture has emerged.
In our culture, becoming a tester who supports the ideas of others is better than just being an idea giver.
What we have received from this project is support for our work, as well as a truly enriching experience contributing to the environmental protection movement in a different way than just replacing light bulbs.
But I think Eleen expressed best what we truly achieved from this, which is the genuine joy from collaboration.
Therefore, she expressed how it feels to see someone on the other side of the world creatively develop your idea, acknowledge your contribution, and then give credit.
If we truly want to see the large-scale change in consumer behavior that we are talking about as environmentalists and food producers, perhaps we just need to abandon the term "consumers."
Open source projects often have their own momentum.
What we are seeing is that R&D - I - Y has gone beyond indoor vegetable growing and using LED lights, stepping into the field of solar energy panels and aquaponic systems.
And we are building on the innovations of the generations that came before us.
And we are looking at the generations that really need us to adjust our lives right now.
Therefore, we would like to invite you to join us in rediscovering the value of citizen solidarity, and declare that we are still pioneers.
I am Denice Frohman, and this is "Accents."
My mother holds her voice like a gun, with two strong hands.
Her tongue, all iron, slides into the middle of her lips, her hips, all laughter and applause.
She speaks in a jumble of Spanish and English, pushing and pulling against each other, at a speed so fast that no one can tell my mother to "be quiet," my mother doesn't know "be quiet."
Her voice suits everyone and it's best not to tell her to be quiet. She has waited too many years for her voice to be heard and cannot accept that it needs to be "cleaned up".
Her English is mixed up in her mouth so "strawberry" becomes "eh-strawbeddy" and "cookie" becomes "eh-cookie" and words like kitchen, key chain, and chicken all sound the same.
My mother doesn't say "yes" but says "ah ha" and suddenly the sky in her mouth turns into a song by Hector Lavoe.
Her tongue cannot be flat enough to speak English, it has too much beauty, too many bones, too many congas, too many strings to jump two steps, too many piano keys between her teeth.
Her words flowed in the conversation among the women, sometimes the hand is all they have, sometimes the hand is all we have, and the local accent reminds us.
My mother's tongue is a slow letter from my grandmother decorated with the sounds of the coqui frog in the countryside, so even though my mother's lips can only open in a limited way with English, her voice is still full of the warmth of the homeland.
Everything is covered by invisible ecosystems formed by microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings all contain microorganisms living in them.
When we design these things, we can think about designing these invisible worlds, and also think about how they interact with our personal ecosystem.
Our bodies are home to trillions of microorganisms, and these organisms determine our nature.
The bacteria in your gut can affect your weight and mood.
The microorganisms on your skin can help boost your immune system.
The bacteria in your mouth can make your breath fresh or not, and the important thing is that our personal ecosystem interacts with the ecosystem on everything we come into contact with.
For example, when you touch a pen, the process of exchanging microorganisms occurs.
If we can design invisible ecosystems in the environment around us, this opens up a pathway to influence our health in ways never seen before.
I always get asked, "Is it possible to design a truly synthetic microbial ecosystem?"
And I believe that the answer is yes.
I think we are doing that right now, but we are doing it unconsciously.
I will share data with you from an aspect of my research focusing on architecture, showing how we are influencing these invisible worlds through both conscious and unconscious design.
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I have worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building.
We want to have something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we take dust samples.
From the dust, we extract bacterial cells, break them open, and compare their gene sequences.
This means that everyone in my team had to vacuum a lot throughout this project.
This is a photo of Tim. Right when I took this photo, he reminded me, saying: "Jessica, the last experimental group I worked with was when I was working in the outskirts of the Costa Rican rainforest, and m
So now I will show you what we have found in the office, and we will review the data through a visualization tool that I have worked with Autodesk on.
The way you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle.
You will see large groups of bacteria, and if you look at the shape of this pink colony, it will tell you something about the relative abundance of each group.
At 12 o'clock, you will see that the office has a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at 1 o'clock, you will find that bacilli bacteria are relatively rare.
Let's look at what is happening in different spaces within this building.
If you look at bathrooms, they all have very similar ecosystems, and if you look at classrooms, they also have similar ecosystems.
But if you look through these types of spaces, you will see that they are completely different from each other.
I like to think of a bathroom as a tropical forest.
I told Tim, "If you could see the microorganisms, it's like being in Costa Rica."
A little bit.
And I also like to think of the office as a peaceful meadow.
This perspective is a very strong perspective for designers, as you can apply ecological principles and an important ecological principle is dispersion, the way living organisms move around.
We know that bacteria are dispersed around by humans and through the air.
Therefore, the first thing we want to do in this building is to check the air conditioning system.
Mechanical engineers design air handling equipment to ensure that people feel comfortable, and that air flow and temperature are suitable.
They do this by using principles of physics and chemistry, but they can also use biology.
If you look at the bacteria in one of the air handling units in this building, you will see that they all look very similar.
And if you compare this to bacteria in another air treatment unit, you will see that they are completely different.
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, which means that mechanical engineers are like ecological engineers, and they have the ability to structure ecosystems within the building in a way that m
Another aspect of how bacteria move is through humans, and designers often arrange rooms together to facilitate interaction between people, or to share ideas, as in a laboratory.
With bacteria traveling alongside humans, you can expect to see rooms close to each other having very similar ecosystems.
And that is what we found.
If you look at classrooms located right next to each other, they have very similar ecosystems, but if you go to an office further away, the ecosystem will be completely different.
And when I see the power that dispersion brings to these geographical regions, it makes me think that it could solve really difficult problems, such as infections caused by bacteria.
I believe this must be part of the issue of ecological architecture construction.
Okay, I will tell you another story about this building.
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
He is an architect, and Charlie is very concerned about global climate change.
He has dedicated his whole life to sustainable design.
When he met me and realized he could quantitatively study how his design choices affect the ecology and biology of this building, he was very excited, because he was going to...
You have shifted from only thinking about energy to also starting to think about human health.
He helped design some air handling systems in this building and how it is ventilated.
The first thing I will show you is the air sample we collected outside the building.
What you are seeing is the signature of the bacterial community in the outdoor air, and how they change over time.
Next, I will show you what happens when we experiment with adjusting the classroom.
We blocked the door at night so they didn't have any ventilation.
Many buildings operate in this way, perhaps even the place you work at, and companies do this to save money on their energy bills.
What we discovered is that these rooms remained relatively quiet until Saturday when we reopened the ventilation pipes.
When you enter those rooms, the air is truly unpleasant, and our data shows that it is related to leaving liquid bacterial matter in the air from the previous day's occupants.
Compare this to rooms designed with sustainable design strategies that do not operate where air enters from the outside through ventilated doors.
In these rooms, the ventilation is quite good, and when Charlie saw this, he was very excited.
I feel like I made a good decision during the design process because it not only saves energy but also cleans up the microhabitat landscape of the building.
The examples I just provided are about architecture, but they are related to designing anything.
Imagine a design with the types of bacteria we want on an airplane or a phone.
There is a new microorganism that I just discovered.
It is called BLIS, and has been proven to have the ability to prevent disease-causing agents and provide you with good breath.
Wouldn't it be great if all of us had BLIS on our phones?
A mindful approach to design that I call biophilic design, and I believe it is possible.
Therefore, I started with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple aired in 1984.
(Video) Brothers and sisters: We are a nation with one will, one determination, one goal.
Our enemies will talk until they die, and we will fight them with their own chaos.
We will win.
Storyteller: On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce the Macintosh.
And you will see why the year 1984 will not be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: Therefore, the fundamental message of this video remains very powerful to this day.
Technology created by innovative companies will help us be free.
Fast forward to over two decades later: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama of Tibet as well as some other politically sensitive apps at the request of the Chinese government for its app store.
They also vet their satirical app in the US because some Apple employees are concerned that it may harm certain groups of people.
His application will not be restored until he wins the Pulitzer Prize.
The German news magazine Stern had its app censored by Apple's care staff for being deemed too suggestive for users, even though in reality the magazine is completely
And more controversially, recently, Apple has censored a protest app by Palestinians after the Israeli government expressed concerns that it could be used to organize violent attacks.
This is the issue.
We are facing a situation where private companies are applying audit standards that are often arbitrary and narrower than the standards of freedom of speech that we have in democratic regimes.
Or they are reacting to censorship requests from authoritarian regimes that do not reflect the consent of the governed.
Or they are responding to requests and concerns from unauthorized governments regarding many or most users and viewers interacting with the content being referenced.
So, here is the situation.
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedom, or the lack thereof, was largely controlled by nations.
But nowadays we have a new class of private power in cyberspace.
And their decisions regarding software code, technology, design, and service terms all act as a kind of law shaping what we can and cannot do in technical life.
And their sovereignty, husbandry, global connectivity, can somehow challenge the sovereignty of nations in a very interesting way, but sometimes it can also enhance and expand it at the same time.
Finally, even the leaders of the free world need a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if they want to be re-elected next year.
And these platforms have certainly been very useful for activists in Tunisia and Egypt during the past spring and beyond.
Like Wael Ghonim, Google's manager at the time, a secret activist on Facebook at night, said to CNN after Mubarak resigned: "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet."
But overthrowing a government is one thing, and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
On the left is a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who participated in the attack on the Egyptian state security office in March.
And many agents have destroyed as many documents as possible and left them in piles.
However, some files are still intact, and some activists have discovered their own surveillance records with full transcripts of email exchanges, phone text exchanges.
And an activist even found a contract from a Western company to sell surveillance technology to the security forces in Egypt.
And activists in Egypt believe that these surveillance technologies are still being used by the network management agencies there.
And in Tunisia, the process of censorship truly began to resurface in May - not as much as during the time of President Ben Ali.
But you will find that this is a blocked page when you try to access certain specific Facebook pages and other websites that intermediaries have identified as potentially inciting violence.
In opposition to this issue, blogger Slim Amamou, who was detained under Ben Ali's regime and later became part of the transitional government after the revolution, resigned from the cabinet in protest.
But there have been many debates in Tunisia about how to handle this type of issue.
In fact, on Twitter, some supporters of the revolution have said: "Actually, we want democracy and freedom of speech, but there are some types of discourse that need to be controlled because they are too violent and can be."
But the question is, how do we determine who has the authority to make these decisions and how do we ensure that they do not abuse their power?
Like Riadh Guerfali, a seasoned digital activist from Tunisia, commented on this issue, "In the past, everything was simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other."
Today, everything becomes much more refined.
The truth is that even in today's democratic societies, we still do not have a good answer for how to balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand, and protecting individual rights on the other.
In fact, in the United States, regardless of what you think about Julian Assange, even those who are not necessarily fans of him are very concerned about how the US government and some companies have handled the issue of Wikileaks.
I'm sorry, but I can only translate from Vietnamese to English. If you have a text in Vietnamese that you would like me to translate to English, please provide it and I will be happy to help.
We assume that the Internet is a borderless technology.
This is a map of social networks around the world, and Facebook has certainly dominated a large part of the world - this can be either good or bad, depending on how you evaluate Facebook's service management.
But boundaries still exist in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan, this is due to unique cultural and language reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam, and some former Soviet Union countries, what is happening there is more concerning.
You are facing a situation where the relationship between the government and local social media companies is creating a scenario where the potential of these platforms is being limited due to the relationships between the companies.
Currently in China, there is the "Great Firewall," as most people know, which blocks Facebook and Twitter and currently Google + and many other foreign websites.
And this is partly achieved thanks to the support of Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The rest of the story is the requirements that the Chinese government sets for all companies operating on the Chinese Internet, known for its self-censorship system.
Simply put, it means reviewing and monitoring their users.
And here is a ceremony that I actually attended in 2009, where the Chinese Internet Society awarded prizes to the top 20 Chinese companies for best self-regulation - that is, the act
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's leading search engine, is one of the award recipients.
In Russia, they often do not block the Internet and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil, which is an anti-corruption website.
And earlier this year, a concerning incident occurred when those who donated to Rospil through a payment processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening calls from members of an ethnic party.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold the government accountable.
Therefore, we are currently facing a situation in the world where the relationship between citizens and governments in many countries is communicated through the Internet, mainly involving private business services.
So the important question, in my opinion, is not whether the Internet helps good people more than bad people or not.
Of course, it will enhance those who are the best at using technology and have the most understanding of the Internet compared to their competitors.
The most urgent question we need to ask today is how to ensure that the Internet develops in a way that is citizen-centered.
Because I believe that all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve the citizens, and I will propose that the sole purpose of technology is to improve life.
So the question is, do we know how to hold the government accountable?
We may not always do that very well, but we have a sense of those models, politically and organizationally, to do that.
How can we hold internet space managers accountable for the community's interests when most CEOs argue that their main responsibility is to maximize profits for shareholders?
And government regulations often do not provide much support for everyone.
You have situations like in France, where President Sarkozy told CEOs of Internet companies, "We are the sole representatives of the public interest."
But then he supported laws like the "three strikes" law that caused a bad reputation, which could disconnect citizens from the Internet for sharing files, a move criticized by the UN Special Rapporteur on Li.
And in the United Kingdom, there is also concern about a law called the Digital Economy Act that places more responsibility on private intermediaries to monitor the behavior of citizens.
What we need to realize is that if we want to have a future Internet that focuses on the people, we need a widespread and sustainable free Internet movement.
Finally, companies are not stopping polluting groundwater in the usual way, or hiring 10-year-old children in the usual way, just because the managers are conscious one day and decide to.
That is the result of decades of hard work, shareholder support, and consumer support.
Similarly, governments do not enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
This is the result of prolonged and persistent political activities where you have appropriate regulations and proper business conduct.
We need to apply a similar approach to the Internet.
We also need to innovate politics.
About eight hundred years ago, the nobles of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer effective, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, recognizing that even the monarch was subject to the law.
This has opened up a cycle of what we can call political innovation, ultimately leading to the idea of consensus among the ruling class - something that was first implemented by the government centuries ago.
So now we need to find a way to build consensus within the network.
Currently, we still do not know.
But that will require innovation not only focused on politics, political geography, but also on solving business management issues, investor behavior, consumer choices, and even
Each of us has an important role in building a world where governments and technology serve everyone in the world, not the other way around.
(Cheers)
As a child, and somehow I crawled around the house, I remember the Turkish rugs, and there were scenes, battle scenes, love scenes.
My point is, look at this, this animal is trying to resist the soldier's stick.
And my mother actually took these photos last week, about our rug, and I remember this to this day.
There is another object, which is a tall piece of furniture with creatures and monsters and even nude scenes - quite scary, especially for a young child like me.
What I remember today is the storytelling subjects, so storytelling has had a strong impact on my work.
And then there was another influence.
I am a teenager, and at the age of 15 or 16, I guess like all other teenagers, we just want to do what we love and believe in.
And that's why I combined two things that I love the most, which are snowboarding and surfing.
Those are quite good ways to escape from the gloomy weather in Switzerland.
Therefore, I have created a combination of two things: I have brought both a snowboard and a surfboard, and I have attached a mast foot to it, along with some foot straps and metal fin bars, and at the
That is truly a deadly trap.
My point is that it is really great, extremely effective, but truly very dangerous.
And then I realized I had to go to design school.
(Smiling) What I mean is, look at those graphics.
(Laughing) So, I went to design school, and that was in the early 90s when I graduated.
And I see something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley, so I want to be there, and I see that computers are coming into our homes, they have to change to be with us in the future.
And that's why I found a job and I am working for a consulting company, and we will participate in these meetings, and the managers will come, and they will say, "Hey, let's go.
And they will name the project, you know, mostly from "Star Wars," actually: like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
Therefore, in anticipation, I will be the young designer at the back of the room, raising my hand and asking a question.
Upon reflection, these may seem like silly questions, such as, "What is the Caps Lock key used for?"
Or "What is this Num Lock key used for?"
You know that, don't you?
Do you know if people really use it?
Do they need it?
"Do they want it in their house?"
(Laughing) What I realized afterwards is that they actually don't want to change the old things; they don't want to change on the inside.
They are really looking for us, the designers, to create leather sets, to put some beautiful things outside the box.
And I don't want to become a colorful house.
That is not something I want to do.
I don't want to become a designer in this way.
And then I saw this quote: "Advertising is the price companies pay for not being creative."
(Laughing) So, I have to start on my own.
So I moved to San Francisco and started a small company, fuseproject.
And what I want to do is important things.
And I want to work not only on the surface, but I want to work on the entire human experience.
And so, the initial projects may seem modest, but they have utilized technology and can turn it into things that people will use in new ways, and may discover some new features.
This is a watch that we made for Mini Cooper, the car manufacturing company, right when it was launched, and it is the first watch with a screen that can switch from horizontal to vertical.
And that allows me to check the secret watch here without bending my wrist.
And other projects, it's really about transformation, about meeting the needs of people.
This is a small piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer, and it is shipped completely flat, then it folds into a coffee table and chairs and many other things.
And a little more experiment: this is a set of lights for Swarovski, and what it does is it changes shape.
So it starts from a circle, becomes a circle, then a square, and finally the number eight shape.
Just draw on a small computer control panel, the entire set of lights will adjust according to the shape you want.
And finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
This is a complex process; it took us about four and a half years.
But truly, I am seeking to create a unique experience with light, a new experience with light.
Therefore, we had to design both the lamp and the light bulb.
And that is a unique opportunity, I think, in design.
And the new experience I am looking for is to provide users with the option to switch from warm, dim light to bright work light.
So the light bulb really did it.
It allows people to convert and combine these two colors.
And it is done very simply: just touch the base of the lamp, and on one side, you can adjust the brightness, and on the other side, you can adjust the color of the light.
Therefore, all of these projects carry a humanitarian significance, and I believe that as designers, we need to carefully consider how we can create a relationship.
Because I believe everyone agrees that as designers, we bring value to businesses as well as users, but I think the greatest value ultimately
And the values that we bring can be related to environmental issues, sustainability, and low energy consumption.
Did you know that they can be related to functionality and beauty; they can be related to business strategy.
But the designer is truly the link between these elements.
Jawbone is a project that you are familiar with and it has human-centric technology.
It senses your skin. It lies on your skin, and it knows when you are talking.
And by knowing when you are speaking, it eliminates other noises that it knows, which are environmental noises.
But what sets Jawbone apart is the humanity. We decided to remove all technology and academic stuff from it, and tried to make it as beautiful as possible.
My point is, think about it: the attention we pay to choosing glasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it's not beautiful, it really shouldn't appear on the face.
And this is what we are pursuing here.
But the way we work at Jawbone is truly unique.
I want to point at something here, on the left.
This is the motherboard, this is one of the components inside that helps this technology work.
But this is the design process: someone is changing the circuit board, placing traces on the board, changing the positions of components, while the designers on the other side are working.
So, it's no longer a matter of lining the skin on a technology anymore.
That is truly about designing from the inside out.
And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, and inputting it into the computer.
And that is what I call being driven by design.
You know, there is a bit of pressure and opposition, but design truly helps define the entire experience from the inside out.
And then, of course, the design is never complete.
And here is a different and fresh way in which we work, because it has never been done before, you have to do all these other tasks.
Packaging, website, and you need to continue to truly impress users in many different ways.
But how do you keep someone when that has never been done before?
And Hosain Rahman, CEO of Aliph Jawbone, truly understands that you need a different structure.
In terms of form and structure, the main difference is that we are partners, it is a collaboration.
We can continue working and contributing to this project, and then we will also share in the rewards.
And here is another project, an approach based on partnerships.
This is called Y Water, and this is a man from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, of Austrian descent, who came to us, and all he wants to do is create a healthy or organic beverage for the.
Therefore, we have worked on this bottle and it is completely symmetrical in all directions.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
The bottles are connected to each other, and you can create different shapes, different forms.
(Smiling) (Applauding) Thank you.
(Applause) And then, as we were doing this, the shape of the bottle when placed upside down reminded us of the letter Y, and then we thought, the words "why" and "why not," perhaps are the ones that...
Therefore, we call it Y Water. And this is another place where everything is combined in the same room: three-dimensional design, ideas, brand building, all...
And another thing about this project is that we bring intellectual assets, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all of these things, but I think, ultimately, what they
And what is particularly valuable is when your design work becomes a creative effort, when others can be creative and do more with it.
This is another project that I think truly simulates that.
This is a laptop for each child, priced at $100.
This painting is awesome.
In Nigeria, people carry their most valuable belongings on their heads.
This girl is carrying a laptop on her head to go to school.
I think, for me, it means a lot.
But when Nicholas Negroponte - who has spoken a lot about this project, he is the founder of OLPC - came to meet us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas.
He wants to bring education and technology, which are important milestones in his life, but also milestones of the mission of the One Laptop Per Child project.
But the third pillar he mentioned is design.
And at that time, I wasn't really working on the computer.
I really don't want to, from the previous adventure.
But the important thing he said is that the design will be the reason why children will love this product, the way we will make it affordable and durable.
And furthermore, he said that he will remove the Caps Lock key and also the Num Lock key.
Therefore, I believed.
We designed it to be special, to look different. It looks like it's for children, but not like a toy.
And then comes the integration of all these amazing technologies that you have heard of, Wi-Fi antennas allowing children to connect; screens that can be read under sunlight; keyboards made from ca
Did you know that all of these amazing technologies have truly emerged because of the passion and dedication of the people at OLPC and the engineers?
They fought with suppliers, they fought with manufacturers.
My point is, they fought like animals to keep everything the same.
And somehow, that determination has created projects like this one - helping the process without destroying the original idea.
And I think this is a very important thing.
So, now you receive these photos - you wake up in the morning, and you see the little ones in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia.
And we left the beige color far behind.
My idea is that it is very colorful, it is very cheerful.
In fact, you can see that each logo has a slight difference.
That's because we have the ability to produce 20 colors for X and O during the production process, which is the name of the computer, and by combining them on the production floor, you will have 20 times 20: you will have 400 l
The lessons learned from seeing children using them in developing countries are unbelievable.
But this is my grandson, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he borrowed the laptop for an afternoon, so I have to take it back.
It's difficult.
(Smiling) And that's just a prototype.
A month and a half later, I returned to Switzerland, and there he was playing with his own version.
Laugh) Like paper, paper and hard cover.
So I will complete with one final project, and this is a bit more than just a game for adults.
(Smiling) Some of you may have heard about the New York City condom.
It was just released, on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago.
Therefore, the New York Department of Health reached out to us and they need a way to distribute 36 million free condoms to the people of New York.
A fairly large project, and we have been working on the distribution machines.
These are distribution machines.
There is a friendly shape.
It's like designing a fire extinguisher, and it must be easy to maintain: you need to know where it is and what its function is.
And we also design the condoms themselves.
And I had just arrived in New York when they were released, and I went to see all the places where they were installed: at a small store owned by a Puerto Rican; at a bar on Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
My point is, they are being installed in clinics for the homeless - everywhere.
And here is the public service announcement for this project.
(Music) (Laughter) Buy some.
(Applause) And this is the place where design can spark a conversation.
I have been to these places, and everyone is very excited to have them.
They were excited.
That is breaking the ice, overcoming a fear, and I think that is something that design can do.
Therefore, I was thinking of throwing some condoms into the room and things like that, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate here.
(Smiling) Okay, sure, got it.
I only have a little.
(Smiling) (Welcoming) Well, I have more, you can always ask for more later.
(Smiling) And if someone asks why you carry a condom, you can say that you like its design.
(Smiling) So, I will end with one final thought: if we work together to create value, but if we truly hold the values of the work we do in our hearts, I...
We can change these values, we can change the companies we work with, and ultimately, together, we can change the world.
So thank you.
What if you could only see one color?
Imagine, for example, that you can only see things in red and everything else is completely invisible to you.
As it is known, that is how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a very small part of the full spectrum of light.
There are many different types of light that appear around you every day but are invisible to the human eye, from radio waves carrying your favorite songs, to X-rays that doctors use to look inside your body, to microwaves.
To understand how they can all be light, we will need to know a few things about what light is.
Light is an electromagnetic wave with properties of both waves and particles.
Light waves are like waves on the sea.
There are big waves and small waves, there are waves crashing against the shore continuously, and there are waves that only occasionally trickle onto the land.
The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and the frequency at which it appears is called its frequency.
Imagine yourself as a boat on the ocean, floating up and down as the waves carry you away.
If the waves on that day are long, they will make you dive less frequently, or at a lower frequency.
If, on the other hand, the waves have a shorter wavelength, they will be closer together and you will float up and sink down more frequently, with a higher frequency.
Different types of light are all waves, they only have different wavelengths and frequencies.
If you know the wavelength or frequency of a light wave, you can also calculate its energy.
Long waves have low energy, while short waves have high energy.
Easy to remember if you think about being on that boat.
If you are surfing on a short, choppy wave day, you may also be very energetic, running around to keep everything from falling apart.
But on the ocean waves with long strides, you will drift comfortably, relaxed, with low energy.
The energy of light informs us how it will interact with matter, such as the cells in our eyes.
When we look, it is because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eyes called the retina.
Our retinas are only sensitive to light within a very small range of energy, so we call that range of light visible light.
In our cornea, there are special sensory receptors called spines and cones.
The brightness measuring bars, so we know how much light there is.
The roses adjust their color based on the light we see because different roses are sensitive to different light energies.
Some chromosomes are more excited by light with long wavelengths and low energy, while others are more excited by light with short wavelengths and high energy.
When light touches our eyes, the relative amount of energy that each photoreceptor measures will send signals to the brain for us to perceive colors.
The rainbow we see is actually light seen in the order of its energy.
On one side of the rainbow is low-energy light that we see as red, and on the other side is high-energy light that we see as blue.
If the light shining on us has energy that our retinas cannot measure, we will not be able to see it.
Light with wavelengths that are too short or energy that is too high will be absorbed by the surface of the eye before it can reach the retina, and light with wavelengths that are too long does not have enough energy to stimulate the retina.
The only thing that makes one type of light different from another is its wavelength.
Radio waves have long wavelengths, while X-rays have short wavelengths.
And the visible light, the type of light that you can actually see, is somewhere in the middle.
Although our eyes cannot detect light outside the visible range, we can build specialized detection devices that are stimulated by different wavelengths of light, similar to digital eyes.
With these devices, we can measure light that may not be visible to the naked eye.
Although they may seem different, the warmth you feel from a burning fire is similar to the sunlight shining on you on a beautiful day, like the UV light you apply to sunscreen for protection.
Now, those examples are all things on Earth, things you experience in daily life, but this is something even more amazing.
When you think about the night sky, you may imagine being able to see the bright twinkling stars with your own eyes, but that is just the visible light that you now know r
If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one colored pencil - quite sad.
In order to see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right pair of eyes, and that means using special astronomical glasses that can help us see farther than the naked eye.
You may have heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen beautiful images captured in visible and ultraviolet light.
But you may not know that there are 20 space telescopes in operation, each capable of observing a portion of the full spectrum of light.
With telescopes serving as our virtual eyes, both in space and on Earth, we can see marvelous things.
And the most wonderful thing is, no matter the waves or energy, the light that we see in the distant universe is also something that we can experience and study here on Earth.
Therefore, when we understand the physics of how X-rays, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study light from a distant star or galaxy and learn about the type of event that led to it.
As you continue your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and cannot see.
Knowing just a little about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum of colors around you at all times.
Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
Of course, there are other challenges as well - healthcare, the burden of diseases and pandemics, environmental challenges, and, of course, extreme terrorism.
However, within the scope where we can truly address the challenge of economic growth, that will be a significant step towards addressing the challenges I have just mentioned.
More importantly, until we address the issue of economic growth and create sustainable economic growth, we will not be able to solve the challenges that still exist today.
The basic question is: How can we generate economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and European countries when they are still struggling to create prosperity?
They continue to perform poorly and witness a decline in the three main factors of economic growth: capital, labor, and productivity.
In particular, these developed economies continue to face debts and deficits, as well as a decline and erosion in both the quality and quantity of labor, as well as stagnation in productivity.
In the same direction, we will create economic development in emerging markets, where 90% of the world's population lives and where on average 70% of the population is under 25 years old.
In these countries, achieving a minimum growth rate of 7% per year is necessary to reduce poverty and double the average income in a person's lifetime.
And yet, nowadays, the largest emerging economies - countries with at least 50 million people - still struggle to reach that magical 7% milestone.
The situation is getting worse, with countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil, and even China experiencing a decrease of under seven percent, and in many cases, even going backwards.
Economic growth is important.
With economic development, countries and societies are entering a cycle of positive growth in mobility, opportunities, and improved quality of life.
Without development, countries will decline and deteriorate, not only in economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how life is experienced.
Economic development is crucial for individuals.
If growth declines, the risk to human progress and the risk of increased political and social instability increase, and society becomes darker, coarser, and smaller.
Important context.
And countries in emerging markets do not need to develop at the same pace as developed countries.
Now, I know that some of you in this room will see this as a risky proposition.
Some people here will come back and feel disappointed with what has happened in the world and basically attribute it to economic development.
You are concerned about the issue of overpopulation on the planet.
And when looking at recent statistics and predictions by the United Nations that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before stabilizing in 2100, you worry about the impact of that on natural resources.
You also care about environmental degradation.
And you are concerned about how people, manifested through global businesses, have become greedy and corrupt.
But I am here to tell you today that economic growth has been the cornerstone of the changes in the living standards of millions of people around the world.
And more importantly, it is not only driven by economic growth but also by capitalism.
A simple definition of capitalism is that the means of production, such as trade and industry, capital, and labor, are in the hands of capitalists and not the state.
What is truly important here is that we understand that the essence of criticism is not about economic growth but about what has happened to the capitalist system.
Economic development requires economic freedom, but it must be done correctly.
And as I mentioned earlier, the capitalist system has been defined by private individuals.
And even this, however, is a very simple division.
Capitalism: good; anti-capitalism: bad.
In real-life experience, capitalism is truly prevalent.
And we have countries like China, where state capitalism is more prevalent, and we have countries like the United States, where market capitalism is more developed.
Our efforts to criticize the capitalist system, however, have focused on countries like China where market capitalism is not clearly evident.
However, there is a real reason and a real concern for us today to focus attention on the pure forms of capitalism, especially those forms exemplified by the United States.
This is important because this type of capitalism is increasingly criticized for creating conditions for corruption and, worse, widening income inequality - the idea that a few are benefiting at the top.
Two truly important questions that we need to address are how to repair the capital system so that it can contribute to economic development, while also helping to solve
To contemplate that scene, we must ask ourselves, how does the capitalist system operate today?
Simply put, capitalism is built on the foundation of an individual maximizing their own interests - a selfish individual pursuing what they desire.
And only after they have maximized their own utility, they decide that providing support to other social contracts is important.
Of course, in this system, tax authorities and governments use a portion of their income to fund social programs, recognizing that the role of the government is not only to regulate but also to be a steward of societal values.
However, this framework - this two-stage framework - is the basis on which we must now start thinking about how to improve the capitalist model.
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
First of all, we can refer to the policies of our allies to see what benefits we can gain in thinking about how to improve the capitalist system.
In particular, forward-looking policies often focus on conditional transfer measures, where we pay and reward those who actually carry out tasks that we believe can help enhance t
For example, sending a child to school, parents can earn money from that, or getting their child vaccinated or building immunity for their child, parents can receive monetary rewards for that.
Now, it has nothing to do with the debate about whether we should pay others to do what we think they should do, the truth is that paying based on performance has brought about m
But there are also benefits and significant changes happening in the policies shifting towards the left.
Arguments for the government to expand its role and responsibilities to avoid limitations and for the government to play a more important role in coordinating the factors of production have become common.
But we have also started to debate the role of the private sector should move away from being just profit-driven and should actually be more involved in implementing social programs.
Corporate social responsibility programs, although small in scale, are moving in the right direction.
Of course, left-leaning policies have tended to blur the lines between government, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the United States in the 19th century, when infrastructure development was truly about public-private cooperation.
Recently, the emergence of the Internet has also proven to the world that the public and private sectors can collaborate together for the good development of society.
My basic message to you is: We cannot continue to address the challenges of global economic growth through unnecessary rigidity and superstition.
To achieve sustainable, long-term economic growth and address the ongoing challenges and social issues that continue to plague the world today, we will need to broaden our vision of the approaches.
Finally, we must realize that political ideology is the enemy of development.
Tràng pháo tay) Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a few questions, Dambisa, because someone could react to your last sentence by saying that growth is also an idea, perhaps an idea of ​​chi
What do you think about people who react like that?
DM: I think that is completely valid, and I believe we have been having that conversation.
Currently, there are many jobs being done around happiness and other indicators used to measure human success and improve living standards.
And therefore, I think we should open the door to things that can improve the living conditions of everyone and continue to reduce poverty worldwide.
BG: So you are calling for the restoration of development, but the only way for that to happen without impacting the Earth's capacity, for us to embark on a long journey, is for economic growth.
Do you see that happening?
DM: I think I am more optimistic about the abilities and creativity of humans.
I think if we start limiting ourselves by using finite, scarce, and depleted resources that we know of today, we may become negative and worried about.
However, we have seen the Rome Council, we have seen the previous statements that the world will run out of resources, and it is undeniable that those things are not unreasonable.
But I think that, with creativity, we can see the desalination of seawater, I think that we can reinvest in energy, so that we can truly achieve better results.
And so, in that sense, I am more optimistic about what humans can achieve.
BG: What impresses me about your proposals for restoring growth and expanding in a different direction is that you are suggesting to address the capital issue by applying additional equity capital.
Are you suggesting that?
DM: I suggest that we should open up.
I think it is completely right to say that traditional economic growth models do not operate in the way we desire.
And I believe it is not a coincidence that today the world's largest economy, the United States, has a democratic system, freedom of democracy, as the core political ideology and a capitalistic free market.
The second largest economy is China.
It prioritized less democracy and had a state capitalist model, which is a completely different model.
These two countries, with completely different political and economic models, yet share the same income inequality index measured by the Gini coefficient.
I think those debates are the debates that we should have, because it is not clear which model we should apply, and I think there should be more discussions and...
BG: One final question.
The COP21 conference is taking place in Paris.
If you could send a tweet to all the leaders and delegates there, what would you say?
DM: Once again, I emphasize the importance of being open-minded and open-hearted.
As you know, environmental issues have been brought up many times for discussion - in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm - and we keep coming back to this issue partly because there is no basic consensus, in fact.
Emerging market countries need to continue to generate economic growth to avoid political uncertainty in those countries.
Developed countries recognize that they have a real responsibility, not only to manage the amount of CO2 emissions and some forms of degradation they are contributing to the world, but also to be leaders in research.
And so they also have to come to the table.
But fundamentally, we cannot consider the situation as us starting to attach policies to emerging markets without developed countries also carefully evaluating what they are doing in terms of supply and demand.
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.
Statistics is persuasive.
To the point where individuals, organizations, and even countries rely on some of their most important decisions based on organized data.
But there is an issue with that.
Any dataset can contain something hidden within it, something that can completely flip the results.
For example, imagine you need to choose between two hospitals to perform surgery on an elderly loved one.
Out of 1000 recent patients at each hospital, 900 people survived at Hospital A, while only 800 people survived at Hospital B.
So it seems like Hospital A is the better choice.
But before you make a decision, remember that not all patients coming to the hospital have the same level of health.
And if we divide the final patient groups of each hospital into groups of patients who arrive at the hospital in good health and those who arrive in poor health, the picture becomes clearer.
Hospital A only has 100 patients with poor health conditions, of which 30 have survived.
But Hospital B has 400 people and they have saved 210 lives.
Therefore, Hospital B is a better choice for patients who come to the hospital in poor health condition, with a survival rate of 52.5%.
And how is the health of your loved one when she goes to the hospital?
Interestingly, Hospital B is still a better choice, with a survival rate of over 98%.
So how can Hospital A have an overall better survival rate if Hospital B has a better survival rate for patients in each group?
What we have discovered is a case of the phenomenon known as Simpson's paradox, where the same dataset can exhibit conflicting trends depending on how it is grouped.
This often happens when data is aggregated hiding a confounding variable, sometimes known as a hidden variable, which is a hidden additional factor that significantly affects the outcome.
Here, the hidden factor is the relative proportion of patients coming in with good or poor health conditions.
The Simpson's paradox is not just a hypothetical situation.
It appears sometimes in the real world, sometimes in important contexts.
A study in the United Kingdom has shown that smokers have a higher survival rate compared to non-smokers over a period of twenty years.
It was not until the groups were divided by age that it became apparent that non-smokers were significantly older on average, and therefore more likely to die during the trial period, precisely because they lived longer.
Here, age groups are the hidden variables, and it is important to understand the data correctly.
In another example, an analysis of death penalty cases in Florida did not seem to find any racial disparities in the sentencing of black and white defendants convicted of murder.
But dividing cases by the race of the victims tells a different story.
In both situations, the black defendants are more likely to face a higher risk of being sentenced to death.
The overall penalty rate is slightly higher for white defendants because cases with white victims are more likely to result in the death penalty compared to cases with black victims, and most murder cases.
So what should we do to avoid falling into the wrong spiral?
I'm sorry, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.
Data can be grouped and divided in any way, and the total can sometimes provide a more accurate picture than data divided into deceptive or arbitrary groups.
We can only carefully study real-life situations that statistics describe and consider whether there may be any hidden variables at play.
If not, we will make ourselves vulnerable to those who use data to exploit others and advance their own policies.
That is a diagram of the visual system.
And some things look very familiar today.
There are two eyes below, and the optic nerve flows out from behind.
There is a very large nose that doesn't seem to be related to anything specific.
And if we compare this to more recent developments in the visual system, you will see that everything has become significantly more complex over the past thousand years.
And that is because nowadays we can see what is inside the brain, instead of just looking at its overall shape.
Imagine you want to understand how a computer works and all you see are just a keyboard, a mouse, and a screen.
You will be really unlucky.
You want to be able to open it up, break it apart, and look at the wires inside.
And until about a century ago, no one could do that with the brain.
No one has a complete understanding of the structure of the nervous system in the brain.
And that happens because if you take the brain out of the skull and cut a thin slice of it, put it under a strong microscope, there is nothing there.
It's gray, shapeless.
No structure.
It will not tell you anything.
And all of this changed at the end of the 19th century.
Suddenly, new chemical dyes for the brain have been developed and they have helped us see the brain's connectivity structure for the first time.
The computer has been turned on.
The true beginning of modern neuroscience was a dye called Golgi stain.
And it operates in a very special way.
Instead of staining all the cells inside a tissue, it only stains about one percent of them.
It cleans the forest area, revealing the trees inside.
If everything is labeled, nothing will be seen.
Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a Spanish neuroscientist, is considered the father of modern neuroscience. He applied the Golgi staining technique, generating data like this, and truly introduced modern concepts.
And if you think of the brain as a computer, this is the electronic circuit.
And very quickly, Cajal realized that nerve cells do not function individually, but instead connect with each other to form circuits like in a computer.
Today, after a century, when researchers want to visualize nerve cells, they will illuminate them from the inside instead of darkening them.
And there are some ways to do this.
But one of the most common methods related to green fluorescent protein is.
Now the protein glows green, but interestingly it comes from a glowing jellyfish, very useful.
Because if you can take the gene to create a green glowing protein and transfer it to a cell, that cell will glow green - or any variant of the green glowing protein, you can make m
And returning to the topic of the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow".
And it is called that, of course, because all these nerve cells glow in different colors.
Nowadays, sometimes neuroscientists need to identify the individual molecular components of nerve cells, molecules, instead of the entire cells.
And there are many ways to do this, but one of the most common ways involves the use of antibodies.
And you are familiar, of course, with antibodies as the foot soldiers of the immune system.
But it seems that they are very useful for the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, such as the outer shell protein of a virus invading the body.
And researchers have used this fact to identify specific molecules inside the brain, identify specific subcellular structures of cells, and determine their individual characteristics.
And many of the images that I have shown you here are very beautiful, but also very powerful.
They have an excellent explanatory power.
Here, for example, is a method of staining antibodies against serotonin transporters in a mouse brain slice.
And have you heard about serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases such as depression and anxiety.
Have you heard of SSRIs? They are a type of medication used to treat these conditions.
And to understand how serotonin works, it is very important to understand where the serotonin machinery is located.
And antibody staining reactions like this can be used to understand that question.
I want to leave you with the following thought: Protein that glows green and antibodies are both completely natural products from the start.
They have evolved by nature to make a jellyfish glow in green for any reason, or to detect the protein coat of an invading virus, for example.
And only after a long time, new scientists emerged and said, "Hey, here are the tools, here are the functions that we can use in our research toolbox."
Instead of using the weak human mind to design these tools from scratch, there are solutions readily available in nature that have been developed and perfected continuously over millions of years by the greatest engineers.
I grew up in Seoul, South Korea, and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
At that time, I was studying for a medical degree, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in the body's structure and practicing surgery on animals had already...
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I began to realize that I could see the entire city as a living creature.
I want to analyze it and see its invisible layers.
And the path to it, for me, is through the means of art.
Finally, I decided to pursue a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree instead of a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree.
And when I was in university after college, I began to take an interest in the creatures living in the hidden corners of the city.
In New York City, rats are a part of the daily life of commuters.
Most people ignore them or are afraid of them.
But I liked them because they live on the fringes of society.
And although they are used in laboratories to improve human life, they are also considered harmful species.
I also started to learn about the city and tried to take photos of them.
One day, on the subway, I was taking photos of the tracks hoping to capture a mouse or two, and a man approached me and said, "You are not allowed to take photos here."
MTA will confiscate your camera.
I will follow the mice.
After that, I started to explore the underground tunnels, which made me realize that there is a whole new depth of the city that I had never seen before and that most people do not have the opportunity to see.
At that time, I met people with the same aspirations who called themselves urban explorers, adventurers, cave explorers, and "flag travelers" historians.
I have been welcomed into this open network, based on the Internet, of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, water conduits, factories, hospitals.
When I take photos at these locations, I feel like there is something missing in the pictures.
Simply taking notes about structures that are about to be destroyed is not enough for me.
Therefore, I want to create a fictional character or a species of animal living in the underground spaces, and the simplest way to do that, at that time, is to model myself.
I decided not to choose a costume because I want that figure to not carry any specific cultural significance or any particular time period.
I want a simple way to describe a living body living in these abandoned, dilapidated spaces.
This is a photo taken at the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
Now there is a six-hectare plot of land waiting to be developed into a shopping center right across from Ikea's new store.
I really like this space because it is the first large industrial complex that I found abandoned on my own.
The first time I went in, I was scared because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
But they are wild dogs living there, and the place is right next to the water, so there are swans and ducks swimming around, trees growing everywhere, and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
Nature has truly taken over the entire complex.
And somehow, I want the image of the person in the painting to become a part of nature.
When I feel comfortable in that space, it also feels like a big playground.
I will climb onto the barrels and jump over the iron bars as if I have gone back in time and become a child again.
This is a photo taken at the old Croton water system, which provided clean water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
It lasts about five years.
It was abandoned when the new Croton water pipeline system opened in 1890.
When you enter spaces like these, you are directly accessing the past, as they have not been touched for many decades.
I enjoy the feeling of a space that carries a lot of history.
Instead of looking at its copies at home, you really feel the bricks being hand-stacked and crawling up and down narrow, wet, dirty gaps and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
This is a tunnel under Riverside Park.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
The wall paintings were created by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people who were relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
There is no one around you, and you hear the sound of children playing in the park above, completely unaware of what is below.
When I frequently go to many places like that, I feel very anxious and lonely because I am in a phase of solitude in my life, and I decided to name my series "Naked City S."
"Naked City" is the nickname of New York, and "Spleen" expresses the melancholy and stagnation that comes from feeling lost in an urban environment.
This is the same tunnel.
You see the sun rays shining through the ventilation ducts and the ship approaching.
This is an abandoned tunnel in the Hell's Kitchen area.
I was there alone, arranging things, and a homeless man came close.
I am basically intruding into his personal space.
At first, I was really scared, but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he seemed uninterested, so I moved forward and set up the machine.
And when I finished, he even offered me to borrow his shirt to wipe my feet and kindly escorted me outside.
That must have been a very unusual day for him.
One thing that impressed me after this incident is that the space contained many erased memories of the city.
That homeless man, to me, truly represents an element of the city's subconscious.
He told me that he had been abused on the streets and had once been in Riker's Island prison, and finally he found peace and tranquility in that space.
The tunnel was built to serve the prosperity of the city, but now it has become a refuge for those completely forgotten in the daily lives of ordinary urban residents.
This is at the foot of my university, Columbia University.
The tunnels are famous for being used in the development of the Manhattan project.
This tunnel is special because it reveals the original foundation of the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, a facility that was destroyed in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This is the New York City Farm Colony, a poorhouse facility on Staten Island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are taken in abandoned places over many decades, but this one is an exception.
This children's hospital closed in 1997; it is located in Newark.
When I arrived there three years ago, the window was broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there just like that.
You see the autopsy table, morgue tray, X-ray machine, and even the tools that have been used, which you see on the autopsy table.
After exploring recently abandoned buildings, I felt that everything could collapse very quickly: your house, your office, a shopping center, a church - any structure.
I remember that our sense of security can be very fragile and humans are truly very vulnerable.
I really enjoy traveling, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
This place is full of history, as well as underground tunnels and remnants from the war.
This is a photo taken at a refugee camp for homeless people built in 1885 to accommodate 1,100 individuals.
I saw that structure while on the train, and I got off at the next station and met someone there who gave me access to a basement-like area, which was used to store ammunition during wartime.
These are the real underground caves in Paris.
I carefully explored the restricted areas and fell in love at first sight.
There are over 185 caves, and only about one cave is open to the public as a museum.
The first tunnels were built in 60 BC.
They are often excavated like limestone quarries and in the 18th century, the collapse of some of these quarries posed safety risks, so the government ordered the reinforcement of existing quarries and the excavation of new observation tunnels.
As you can see, the system is very complex and extensive.
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
At the same time, the city is also facing issues with overflowing cemeteries.
Therefore, the bodies have been moved from cemeteries to quarries, turning them into tombs.
The remains of over six million people are contained within it, some over 1,300 years old.
This is a photo taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery, where most of the tombs are located.
There were both telephone cables used in the 1950s and many bunkers from World War II.
This is a German bunker.
Nearby is a French fortress, and the underground tunnel system is so complex that the two sides never meet.
The sewers are famous for being used by the Resistance Forces, which Victor Hugo wrote about in his work "Les Misérables."
And I have seen many paintings on the walls from the 19th century, like this one.
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed up a Gothic architectural structure right in the heart of Paris.
This is the Saint Jacques Tower.
It was built in the early 1500s.
I do not recommend sitting on a sacred statue in the middle of January, naked.
It is not very comfortable.
(Laughing) And during that time, I had never seen a mouse in any of those places, until recently, when I was in the sewer system in London.
This is probably the most difficult place to explore.
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic gas - I guess unless in this photo.
When the waste stream flows in, it sounds like a storm approaching you.
This is a frame from a movie that I recently worked on, called "Blind Door."
I have become more interested in documenting movement and structure.
And this is the first theater project that I have worked on.
I have adapted and produced the play "A Dream Play" by the author August Strindberg.
It was performed only once in September last year in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn, considered the oldest subway tunnel in the world, built in 1844.
Recently, I have been leaning towards collaborative projects like this more.
But whenever I have the chance, I still work on my novel.
The last place I visited was the Maya ruins in Copan, Honduras.
This was taken inside an archaeological excavation pit in the main temple.
I like to do more than just explore these spaces.
I feel responsible for making these spaces lively and continuously humanizing them to creatively preserve their memories - before they disappear forever.

Until we can trace our origins, humans have been fascinated by death and rebirth.
Nearly every religion in the world has its own interpretation, from the earliest myths to the latest blockbuster movies, the dead always come back.
But is resurrection really possible?
