Brother Albert Barnett and his wife, Sister Susan Barnett, from the West Congregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama
Severe storms ripped through parts of the southern and midwestern United States on January 11 and 12, 2020.
Two days of heavy rain, high winds, and numerous tornadoes caused major damage across multiple states.
Sadly, Brother Albert Barnett and his wife, Sister Susan Barnett, 85 and 75 years old respectively, were killed when a tornado struck their mobile home.
The United States branch also reports that at least four of our brothers' homes sustained minor damage, along with two Kingdom Halls.
Additionally, the storms caused major damage to a brother's business property.
Local elders and the circuit overseer are offering practical and spiritual support to those affected by this disaster.
We know that our heavenly Father, Jehovah, is providing comfort to our brothers and sisters who are grieving because of this tragedy.
International government agencies and officials have responded to Russia's Supreme Court decision that criminalizes the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia.
These statements have criticized Russia's unjust and harsh judicial action against a minority religious group known for peaceful religious activity.
On July 17, 2017, a three - judge panel of the Appellate Chamber of Russia's Supreme Court upheld the Court's April 20 decision "to liquidate the religious organization 'Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia' and the local religious organizations that are part of its structure to turn over to the Russian Federation all property of the liquidated religious organization."
With this decision, the Court effectively banned the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout Russia.
The following are excerpts of statements made after the July 17, 2017, decision by the Appellate Chamber of Russia's Supreme Court to uphold the April 20 ruling:
We are deeply concerned by the decision of Russia's Supreme Court to reject the appeal of the Jehovah's Witnesses against their labelling as' extremists. '
This ruling confirms the criminalisation of the peaceful worship of 175.000 Russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom that is enshrined in the Russian Constitution.
- Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister for Human Rights, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Great Britain.
The Russian Supreme Court's decision this week against the Jehovah's Witnesses is the latest in a disturbing trend of persecution of religious minorities in Russia.
We urge the Russian authorities to lift the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses' activities in Russia, to reverse the closing of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center, and to release any members of religious minorities that continue to be unjustly detained for so - called 'extremist' activities.
- Heather Nauert, Department Spokesperson for the U.S.Department of State.
"Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
- Spokesperson for the European Union External Action Services.
The Supreme Court's decision sadly reflects the government's continued equating of peaceful religious freedom practice to extremism.
The Witnesses are not an extremist group, and should be able to practice their faith openly and freely and without government repression.
- Daniel Mark, Chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.
I am very concerned by the fact that the court ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia has been upheld.
Despite our appeals on a number of levels, this move makes the peaceful enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion and thought a criminal offence.
- Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation With Russia, Central Asia, and the Eastern Partnership Countries, Foreign Ministry of Germany.
Russia's recent outrageous decision to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses from existing as a recognized faith community in Russia is a complete violation of the protections for freedom of religion and belief in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
People of goodwill from all faith communities as well as all those who cherish freedom of conscience rights must stand in solidarity with the Jehovah's Witnesses of Russia.
- Dr.Katrina Lantos Swett, president, Lantos Foundation.
Prior to the Appellate Chamber's decision, numerous government agencies and officials condemned the Russian Supreme Court's April 20 ruling:
"I asked President Vladimir Putin to use his influence to guarantee minority rights here as well as with Jehovah's witnesses."
- Chancellor Angela Merkel, during a news conference with President Putin.
"The recent decision of the Supreme Court to declare the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center in the Russian Federation an extremist organisation, and to close it down, together with the 395 Local Religious Organisations used by Witnesses, raises serious concerns regarding freedom of religion in Russia and is another example of the legislation against extremism being abused to curtail freedom of expression and assembly."
- Theodora Bakoyannis and Liliane Maury Pasquier, co-rapporteurs of the PACE Monitoring Committee for the Russian Federation.
Russia's failure to respect religious freedom is yet another inexcusable violation of Moscow's OSCE commitments.
People who practice their faith peacefully should never be in danger of being harassed, fined, or jailed.
The court order to seize organization property owned by Jehovah's Witnesses adds insult to injury.
I am hopeful that this case will be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.
- Senator Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Yesterday's decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to ban the activities of the Administrative Centre of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia on grounds of 'extremism' could make it possible to launch criminal prosecutions against Jehovah's Witnesses for mere acts of worship.
Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards.
I'm deeply concerned by this unwarranted criminalization of the peaceful activities of members of the Jehovah's Witnesses communities in Russia, eliminating this community as a viable entity in the country.
This Supreme Court decision poses a threat to the values and principles that democratic, free, open, pluralistic and tolerant societies rest upon.
- Michael Georg Link, Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.
This ban persecuting peaceful persons for mere acts of worship clearly violates the fundamental right to religious freedom and with it international human rights standards as also guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation.
It therefore needs to be revised as soon as possible.
- Professor Ingeborg Gabriel, Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson - in - Office on Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Discrimination.
I am alarmed by the decision of Russia's Supreme Court to recognise the Jehovah's Witnesses as' extremists'.
This ruling effectively criminalizes the peaceful worship of 175,000 Russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom which is enshrined in the Russian Constitution.
The UK calls on the Russian government to uphold its international commitment to this basic freedom.
- Baroness Joyce Anelay, former Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
On July 20, 2017, the Permanent Council of the OSCE adopted a statement from the European Union (EU).
The statement calls on Russia to allow Jehovah's Witnesses to "be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
The statement was unanimously adopted in Vienna by all 28 member states of the EU, and other non-EU member countries such as Australia, Canada, and Norway have aligned themselves with it.
Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide are deeply disappointed that with its arbitrary decision, Russia's Supreme Court has effectively banned their worship throughout the country.
In their responses, international government agencies and officials expose Russia for unjustly declaring Jehovah's Witnesses "extremists" and for ignoring its own constitutional and international commitments to protect religious freedom.
The European Court of Human Rights has yet to hear this matter and will hopefully reverse the nationwide ban.

Dismantling Saigon's Binh Trieu tollgates finished
As of Monday afternoon, November 2, the HCMC authorities finished dismantling the Binh Trieu 1 Bridge and Binh Trieu 2 Bridge tollgates in Thu Duc District, which had been nonoperational for four years.
The HCMC Infrastructure Investment Company, investor of the build - operate - transfer (BOT) Binh Trieu Bridge – phase 1 project, put the tollgates into operation in 2005 and shut them down in 2016.
The company maintained the tollgates instead of removing them as it planned to use them for the Binh Trieu Bridge – phase 2 project.
However, the city authorities decided to suspend the BOT Binh Trieu Bridge – phase 2 project in 2017, therefore the tollgates had been left nonoperational since then.
The nonoperational tollgates were identified as one of the causes of traffic congestion in the city, especially during rush hours.
Accidents have been caused by the tollgates as distracted drivers crashed into them.
Following the suggestion of the HCMC Department of Transport, in July 2020 the Roads Management Center has been assigned to the task of removing the tollgates in order to reduce traffic congestion in the area.
15 Chinese, Vietnamese crew missing after Panamanian vessel sinks near central coast
Rescue forces are searching for 15 Chinese and Vietnamese crew of a Panamanian ship that sank off Binh Thuan Province today, December 17th.
The ship, carrying clay from Malaysia to Hong Kong, was in the Binh Thuan sea area at 4:30 p.m. when its captain contacted border guard forces of Phu Quy Island to inform them that the vessel was tilting due to the clay leaning on one side of the ship, the Binh Thuan border guard force said.
Fifteen crew members – 11 Chinese and four Vietnamese – were on board.
But while it was about 1.5 nautical miles away from the Phu Quy Port, the ship tilted hard and sank.
Emergency signals for rescue were continually broadcast from that point.
The Binh Thuan border defense force and the Phu Quy search and rescue station dispatched ships to the scene to rescue the crew members.
But no one was found as of 6:30 p.m.
Despite rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is ongoing.
The search radius has been expanded to three to five nautical miles from the scene of the accident, and additional ships have been deployed.
There seem to be myths and superstitions about nearly every aspect of life, and this includes physical attributes.
Moles, for example, were considered evidence of guilt during the Salem Witch Trials.
And among the Chinese, the shape of your nose is said to reveal whether or not you will be wealthy.
There are also a host of fascinating myths about our present topic: birthmarks.
Birthmarks are n't exactly a rare phenomenon.
In fact, about 80% of us are born with these seemingly random markings on our bodies.
There are several different kinds of birthmarks.
As well as brown pigmented types of birthmarks like moles and café au lait spots, there are reddish vascular types ranging in color and form from tiny, pink marks that are flush with the skin, to dark red puffy sorts.
All these reddish (vascular) markings are caused by blood vessels that lie close to the surface of the skin and show through.
Even though we know that the blood vessel - clumping makes a birthmark, we do n't know why this happens in the first place.
And this is where all the myth, mysticism and juicy superstition comes in.
First on the docket is the maternal impression myth.
This theory suggests that if a woman experiences an especially strong emotion during pregnancy, her baby may be born with a birthmark.
Not only that, but if the woman touches a particular location on her body while experiencing the emotion, that is where the birthmark will appear on her baby's body.
In Iranian lore, meanwhile, it is believed that if a woman touches her stomach while watching a solar eclipse, her baby may well have - you guessed it - a birthmark.
Other myths center around the colors of food.
For example, if the baby ends up with a red birthmark, it is supposedly because the mother wanted to eat strawberries while she was pregnant.
But, if she wanted to eat jelly or beets, her baby gets a port - wine stain.
Chocolate cravings, meanwhile, apparently lead to light brown café au lait spots.
Beyond being a result of pregnancy cravings and gazing at eclipses, birthmarks are also said to be omens about people's lives.
If, for example, you happen to have a birthmark on your right arm, you're sure to be prosperous; but, if it's on your left, you're going to have to pinch some pennies.
Elsewhere, a left - foot birthmark means the person will be massively intelligent, while if it's on the right, they'll love exploration, adventure and travel.
Some birthmarks are also supposedly linked with your manner of death in a previous life.
Is that creepy or what?
Whether or not you put any stock in these myths and beliefs, they can certainly be a lot of fun to learn about - and possibly exploit.
Inventing a story about your death and reincarnation is sure to be a great conversation piece at dinner parties.
Or, you can explain the presence of a certain mark by claiming that your mother desired to stroke a goat with her pinky toe while she pregnant with you.
Stranger things have happened.

(New York) Vietnamese authorities have detained, interrogated, and even tortured Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers who have returned to Vietnam from U.N. High Commission for Refugee (UNHCR) camps in Cambodia, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.
The government is violating an agreement with UNHCR, which is supposed to monitor returning refugees and ensure they are safe.
Drawing on eyewitness accounts and published sources, the 55 - page report, "No Sanctuary: Ongoing Threats to Indigenous Montagnards in Vietnam's Central Highlands," provides fresh information about ongoing religious and political persecution of Montagnards, or indigenous communities, in Vietnam's Central Highlands.
"The Vietnamese government continues to persecute Montagnards once they are out of the sight of international observers," said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
"The international community should oppose their forced return to the Central Highlands as long as the authorities continue to persecute them."
Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to review its participation in promoting and facilitating voluntary repatriation, given the disturbing accounts of mistreatment of returnees, as well as weaknesses in UNHCR's monitoring mechanisms.
It also called on the U.S. government to keep Vietnam on its list of "Countries of Particular Concern" for religious freedom violations, and urged Cambodia to continue to provide temporary asylum to Montagnards, in line with its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention.
Vietnamese officials continue to force Montagnard Christians to sign pledges renouncing their religion, despite passage of new regulations last year banning such practices.
Authorities in some areas restrict freedom of movement between villages – in particular for religious purposes not authorized by the government – and ban Christian gatherings in many areas unless they are presided over by officially recognized pastors.
More worrisome, the Vietnamese government persists in criminalizing peaceful dissent, unsanctioned religious activity and efforts to seek sanctuary in Cambodia, by arresting and imprisoning Montagnards who engage in those activities.
The most harshly treated are evangelical Christians who belong to independent or unregistered house churches and supporters of a non-violent movement for the protection of, and greater control over, ancestral lands.
More than 350 Montagnards have been sentenced to prison since 2001, largely for peaceful political or religious activities.
Most have been charged under Vietnam's Penal Code with vaguely worded national security crimes. These include "undermining the unity policy," "disrupting security" and "causing public disorder".
More than 60 Montagnards have been imprisoned after being forcibly returned from Cambodia, where they were seeking asylum.
The arrests are ongoing: during 2005 alone, at least 142 people – some of whom had been in pre-trial detention for as much as a year – were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.
This is more than double the number imprisoned during the previous year.
At least 30 of those sentenced in 2005 had been arrested in Cambodia or near the border areas.
They were apprehended by Cambodian police and turned over to Vietnamese authorities without having a chance to make an asylum claim with UNHCR.
The report includes an annex listing Central Highland prisoners.
"Serious problems persist for Montagnards in the Central Highlands, and the Vietnamese government continues to gloss them over," said Adams.
For those who think the problems are all in the past, they should think again.
The report includes disturbing testimonies from Montagnards who returned to Vietnam in 2005 from U.N. refugee camps in Cambodia, but then "doubled back" to Cambodia after undergoing harsh treatment in Vietnam.
They describe in detail being detained, interrogated and even tortured upon return to Vietnam.
They also tell of being pressured to recant their religion and threatened not to report any abuses to international delegations and U.N. monitors.
Despite this, UNHCR has made repeated public statements that returnees are under "no particular threat or duress," and that it has "no serious concerns" about the government's treatment of them.
Human Rights Watch called on the Vietnamese government to allow UNHCR full and unfettered access to the Central Highlands, as well as private and confidential meetings with local residents and returnees.
The government should also ensure that there will be no retaliation against those with whom UNHCR meets, or their family members.
"These eyewitness accounts make it clear that some returnees have been tortured and persecuted for their religious and political beliefs," said Adams.
We have given this information to UNHCR.
But it has continued to send people back without the unfettered and confidential access to returnees it needs to protect them properly.
Returnees interviewed by Human Rights Watch gave precise accounts of serious threats and intimidation by Vietnamese authorities prior to visits by UNHCR monitors, who have often been accompanied by Vietnamese government officials and police, and are unable to meet privately with returnees.
Returnees were warned by authorities not to say anything negative to UNHCR officials.
One returnee, who had been beaten and pressured to renounce his religion in police custody, told Human Rights Watch, The UN asked about any mistreatment, but I was too afraid to answer.
I told them I had not been hit or threatened.
I did n't dare tell them I'd been sent to prison, if I told, would have beaten me.
"Meaningful monitoring can not take place in front of Vietnamese officials, or when villagers are threatened not to talk," said Adams.
The UNHCR monitoring missions and the repatriation program are seriously flawed and need to be reconsidered.
These testimonies, which were shown to UNHCR in January 2006, call into question the credibility of its monitoring of returnees and the assumptions on which the memorandum of understanding relating to repatriation is based: that returnees will not be persecuted and that UNHCR will be able to monitor the treatment of returnees to ensure that they are not harmed.
More foreign manufacturers turn to Vietnam amid pandemic: JLL
With the novel coronavirus pandemic and trade tensions driving the shift of production lines from China to Southeast Asia, Vietnam, in particular, seems to have emerged as an attractive destination for investors and manufacturers alike, according to Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) Vietnam.
The real estate consultancy said in a recent statement that multinational manufacturers have been setting up operations in Vietnam for a number of years and this trend is poised to strengthened.
This movement has accelerated over the past 12 - 24 months, with companies looking to diversify their operations and supply chains due to tariffs on goods exported from China to the United States.
Stephen Wyatt, Country Head at JLL Vietnam, noted that Vietnam remains a promising market, with a growing trend during the past few years of manufacturing companies looking to set up operations in the country.
Industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and, therefore, land prices are expected to increase, in line with the long - term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, Wyatt said.
Companies looking to diversify their manufacturing portfolios outside China are attracted to Vietnam, thanks to its proximity to China, free trade agreements and the Government's plans to develop Vietnam into a manufacturing hub for Southeast Asia, according to JLL's latest market report.
Also, the report noted that the average price of land in northern Vietnam reached US$ 99 per square meter per lease term, up 6.5% year - on - year in the first quarter of 2020.
Meanwhile, the figure for the southern region was US$ 101, a year - on - year increase of 12.2%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition, ready - built factories recorded an average price of US$ 3.5 - 5 per square meter per month in both regions.
Vietnamese man cheats, sending staff to be quarantined in his stead
A businessman on the same flight from Hanoi to Hue as Vietnam's 30th Covid - 19 patient sent an employee as his substitute for quarantining.
The substitution was only discovered the next morning, Hoang Nam, Vice Chairman of Quang Tri People's Committee said Monday.
"He flew on the same flight with 'patient 30' from Hanoi to Hue," Nam said.
The unnamed man is the business head of a company that invests in a wind power project in the central province of Quang Tri.
After learning of the substitution, authorities requested the man to present himself for quarantine.
He has since been quarantined at the Tuberculosis and Lung Specialist Hospital in Dong Ha Town in the province.
At 21:30 Friday, four men checked into a hotel in Huong Hoa District, 65 kilometers west of Dong Ha Town.
They were identified as co-passengers of Vietnam's 30th Covid - 19 infection on flight VN1547 from Hanoi to Thua - Thien Hue.
The men were placed in quarantine Sunday.
Authorities only discovered there was a replacement the next morning.
Huong Hoa District authorities are tracking down people the men had come in contact with so as to place them in quarantine, too.
They will also disinfect places visited by the suspects.
The Netherlands invented a record speed wifi router
Researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands have developed successfully a new equipment that permits to transmit wifi with the speed is 300 times faster than that of the ordinary ones.
This device is expected to bring a revolution in using wifi Internet.
According to the researchers, the new wifi router operates based on the principle that in which internet data will be distributed by 'light antenna'.
The 'light antenna' mast is responsible for splitting each wavelength of the laser into separate fibers, each fiber can create infrared ray which becomes wifi internet.
Professor Ton Koonen, from the University of Science, said, the research team was studying light ray to transmit wifi internet.
Ten years ago today, on June 10, 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Russian authorities had perpetrated a grave violation of human rights with a years - long campaign to suppress our brothers' freedom of worship.
The ECHR's judgment directed Russia to pay a sizable fine and to reinstate the registration of the Local Religious Organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow - which the authorities revoked in 2004.
Immediately after the verdict was announced, Brother Ivan Chaykovskiy, then chairman of the Moscow Community of Jehovah's Witnesses, said: This judgment is a victory of common sense over religious intolerance.
I hope that as a result of this judgment, the authorities will quickly restore our legal rights and end the nationwide state - sponsored campaign of harassment against Jehovah's Witnesses.
That optimism quickly vanished, however, as Russian authorities not only failed to abide by the terms of the ECHR ruling but also escalated their campaign of persecuting our brothers across the federation.
This persecution was dramatically expressed when Russia's Supreme Court effectively banned our peaceful worship in 2017, an injustice that has been followed by numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments.
Although ten years old, much of the Court's stinging judgment against Russia remains relevant.
In 2010, the ECHR categorically refuted many of the baseless charges that Russia continues to level against our peaceful fellow believers today.
In summary, the ECHR concluded that the Moscow Justice Department, along with the Moscow courts, had 'no legal basis' for refusing the reregistration of Jehovah's Witnesses. The Court decried the Moscow authorities, asserting that they 'did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality.'
Additionally, Moscow authorities were guilty of violating the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Russia is a State Party.
In 2020, as in 2010, Russia's systemic campaign against our brothers is not going unnoticed.
'For Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, practicing their faith means risking their freedom,' said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director for Human Rights Watch.
In a statement dated January 9, 2020, she added: 'There is nothing remotely justifiable about this.'
In the face of injustice, we pray in full confidence that Jehovah will continue to strengthen our brothers and sisters in Russia to 'endure fully with patience and joy.'
19 overseas returnees take Vietnam's Covid - 19 infections to 233
Vietnam confirmed six more Covid - 19 cases early Friday, five returning from abroad and one related to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital.
"Patient 231," 57, is an employee of the Truong Sinh Company, the food and logistics provider to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital, now the nation's biggest Covid - 19 hotspot.
She is a native of Bac Kan, living in the Kim Ngu Commune, Na Ri District.
On March 31, she joined a team at the Bach Mai Hospital for a business trip to the nearby Ha Nam Province.
After learning about the infection cases at Bach Mai, the Ha Nam health sector isolated members of this team.
After she tested Covid - 19 positive, she was admitted to Ha Nam General Hospital for treatment.
She takes the number of patients linked to the Bach Mai Hospital to 43, 27 of whom are employees of the Truong Sinh Company.
The other five patients are people quarantined on arrival from abroad.
Patients 228, 229 and 230 returned to Vietnam on March 20 and were quarantined in the northern province of Ninh Binh.
Further details of their flights home have not been revealed.
"Patient 228" is a 29 - year - old man from the northern province of Bac Giang now undergoing treatment at a medical center in Ninh Binh Province's Ninh Thang Commune, Hoa Lu District.
"Patient 229" and "Patient 230," women aged 30 and 28 respectively, are from the central province of Ha Tinh who have been admitted to the Ninh Binh General Hospital for treatment.
Patients "232" and "233" flew back to Vietnam March 27 on Aeroflot flight SU290 from Moscow and were quarantined in the northern province of Vinh Phuc.
They are being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi's Dong Anh District.
"Patient 232" is a 67 - year - old man from the southern province of Ba Ria - Vung Tau and "Patient 233" is a 24 - year - old woman from Nghe An Province in central Vietnam.
Of the 233 cases of new coronavirus infection confirmed in Vietnam until now, 75 have been discharged from hospitals.
Vietnam declared Covid - 19 a national epidemic Wednesday afternoon.
To date, the Covid - 19 pandemic has claimed almost 53,000 lives in 204 countries and territories.
No person coming from any area that has experienced a Covid - 19 outbreak will be allowed to enter Vietnam, the PM directed Tuesday.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply the new policy to South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and all other countries and territories that have reported cases of Covid - 19 caused by the novel coronavirus.
Vietnam has so far achieved positive results in fighting the Covid - 19, but the epidemic has entered its next stage, spreading to many other parts of the world and is now developing complicatedly and unpredictably in South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran, the PM noted.
For those who have to enter Vietnam for state affairs or exclusive matters, the government requests them to follow the nation's health declaration procedure and stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Citizens of countries stricken by Covid - 19, but from cities / provinces free of the epidemic, will have to submit a health declaration and submit to further procedures deemed necessary when entering Vietnam.
Vietnamese citizens from China's epidemic hit areas can return home, but only via international border gates and will have to be quarantined for two weeks on entry, continuing the policy being followed for the past month.
For its part, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on all Vietnamese citizens not to travel to affected areas and if such travel is unavoidable, they have to be quarantined on return.
Vietnamese expatriates in epidemic - hit areas have been told to strictly follow regulations and guidance of the local authorities; and advised not to return to Vietnam at this time.
Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam had said earlier Tuesday that in order for the country to achieve the positive results it has so far, Vietnam had been proactively implementing measures to prevent and limit the epidemic from mid-December last year, as soon as reports appeared of the Covid - 19 in China's Wuhan City.
Staring February 1, Vietnam had suspended all flights to and from China and stopped granting tourist visas to Chinese from epidemic - stricken areas.
After South Korea raised its disease alert to the 'highest level,' the Vietnamese government has tightened controls for visitors from that country.
Starting Monday, everyone coming in from South Korea has to make health declarations, and those with symptoms like high fever, coughing and breathing difficulties will be placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.
Now all flights from infected areas in South Korea will be diverted to smaller airports – Van Don in the northern Quang Ninh Province, Phu Cat in the south central Binh Dinh Province and Can Tho in the Mekong Delta.
Saigon and Da Nang are currently quarantining 83 people coming on Monday from South Korea's Daegu City, where a major coronavirus outbreak has been detected.
Some South Koreans who refused to be quarantined has flown home late Tuesday night.
South Korea is making headlines internationally as one of the worst - hit countries and territories by the coronavirus epidemic, recording 977 infections by Tuesday evening, second only to China.
As of Tuesday, the last of the 16 infection novel coronavirus infections detected so far in Vietnam had fully recovered.
Over the past 13 days, no new infection case has been reported in the country.
The Covid - 19 is affecting 39 countries and territories.
Death toll has crossed 2,700, mostly in China, followed by Iran with 15, South Korea with 11 and Italy with seven.
Floods kill runner of Dalat Ultra Trail 2020
A runner of the Ultra Trail 2020 international marathon, which is taking place in the Central Highlands city of Dalat, was found dead this afternoon, June 20 after he was swept away by floodwaters triggered by downpours.
The victim, identified as Thai Don Thanh, was running across a section of the Golden Stream in Lac Duong District's Da Sal Commune when the 40 - year - old resident of HCMC met with the accident, Sai Gon Giai Phong news site reported.
The government of Lac Duong District told Tuoi Tre Online that due to the heavy rain on the same day, floodwater levels rose sharply, while the runners were competing in the rain.
After the accident had occurred, the organizers of the marathon suspended the competition and used vehicles to transport runners back to the starting point.
Over 6,200 local and foreign runners are joining the Dalat Ultra Trail 2020.
Japan is now testing a robot cooking soba noodles at Tokyo station
It is JR East startup Co., Ltd., that has run an experiment on a robot cooking soba noodles for train passengers at Tokyo station recently.
The robot, put at Higashi - Koganei Station on Railway Co. 's Chuo Line, is capable of making 40 soba dishes an hour, about the same as a cook's performance.
The robot takes charge of boiling the noodles while the staffs take charge of putting them on a plate and giving them to the customer.
Based on the information from the East Japan Railway Company, the trial period might be extended to April 15 with the aim to determine whether the robot can work well enough and satisfy the expectations of its noodle - loving customers or not.
According to a staff, by virtue of the robot, it is possible to beat the kitchen heat in the summer as well as the risk of burning from scalding noodle water.
Besides, while the robot boils up noodles, the chef is given an opportunity to have time to do something else, such as dealing with customers, cooking fried food and clearing away dishes.

So how does it store so much information in such a small space?
At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high - speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface.
Each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data does n't live there in a form you can recognize.
Instead, it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains.
In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones.
Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current fed through an electromagnet.
This magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization.
Once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a record's grooves into music.
But how can you get so much information out of just zeroes and ones?
Well, by putting lots of them together.
For example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits.
Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch.
The area density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957.
This amazing advance in storage capacity was n't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations.
A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the reader and writer.
And despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter.
Bits could also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read - back signal.
And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of DNA.
For the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two years.
But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect.
When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss.
Scientists resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one terabit per square inch.
Recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording.
This uses an even more thermally stable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written.
And while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate, nano - sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per square inch or more.
So it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand.
Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death.
a carnivorous plant.
Around the world there are more than 600 plant species that supplement a regular diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, or even frogs and rats.
Scientists believe that carnivory in plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh - munching adaptation holds a major benefit for plants.
Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely on soil for their nutrients.
Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme.
Drawn to the pitcher's vivid colors and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar.
But this pitcher species has an ingredient called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects.
As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns.
Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher plant can consume through its leaves.
Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the fatal funnel of the pitcher plant.
The second victim faces off with the sticky sundew plant.
The sundew's tiny leaves are equipped with a viscous secretion called mucilage.
The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo.
As she struggles, enzymes begin to digest her body.
Special tentacles sense her movement and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip.
Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again to snare their next victim.
Two down, four to go.
The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant.
He enters the roots through a tiny slit in search of food.
But inside, he quickly loses his way through the tangled labyrinth.
A forest of curved hairs prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber with flesh - digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen.
In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants.
She treads on the bladderwort's trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in.
Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside the plant gets digested.
Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit.
Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by sweet - smelling nectar.
The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the world's most infamous carnivorous plant.
His landing triggers tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap snap shut around him.
The spikes interlock to seal his fate.
Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach that digests the beetle's soft tissues.
When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his exoskeleton remains.
The mayfly is the last creature standing.
As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high above the plant's globs of adhesive goo.
She alights on the petals, drinks the nectar, and takes off unscathed.
These long flower stalks keep certain insects away from the carnivore's traps - a way of separating pollinators from food.
Off the mayfly buzzes to live a long and fruitful life – oh.
So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools.
And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with.
And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast.
And from those single points emanated stories.
Some of them were familiar stories.
Some of them were new stories.
And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium.
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.
Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format.
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.
And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world.
This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them.
There are thousands upon thousands of them.
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster.
We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods.
The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called "Wool."
And he actually says that he did n't intend for "Wool" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more.
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one, "Wool 3," which was even longer, culminating in "Wool 5," which was a 60,000 - word novel.
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e - books.
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order.
There was no mediator between him and the audience.
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him.
So this whole project was an experiment.
It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format.
And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called "Black Box."
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind.
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created.
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140 - character limit.
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
Every night, at 8 p. m, you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
I think that's pretty exciting: tune - in literary fiction.
The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them.
They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."
It began with this tweet: "On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."
It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p. m.
when this woman falls to her death.
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives.
One reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
Interestingly, though, it was n't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism.
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line.
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world.
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing," including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.
(Laughter) All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world.
They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress.
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.
And they engage with the real world.
They respond to it.
So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account.
It was Mayor Emanuel.
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department.
This foul - mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.
It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird.
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real - time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it did n't actually happen.
I double checked the newspapers.
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
This is something that does n't usually happen with a Twitter parody account.
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.
One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show.
Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird.
And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text.
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E - P - P - A - S - O - D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way.
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.
I think in nonfiction real - time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day.
And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news.
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.
So with real - time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks.
They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.
You're lifting weights.
The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort until you ca n't continue.
Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting have become unable to contract.
Why do our muscles get fatigued?
We often blame lactic acid or running out of energy, but these factors alone do n't account for muscle fatigue.
There's another major contributor: the muscle's ability to respond to signals from the brain.
To understand the roots of muscle fatigue, it helps to know how a muscle contracts in response to a signal from a nerve.
These signals travel from the brain to the muscles in a fraction of a second via long, thin cells called motor neurons.
The motor neuron and the muscle cell are separated by a tiny gap, and the exchange of particles across this gap enables the contraction.
On one side of the gap, the motor neuron contains a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
On the other side, charged particles, or ions, line the muscle cell's membrane: potassium on the inside, and sodium on the outside.
In response to a signal from the brain, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine, which triggers pores on the muscle cell membrane to open.
Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out.
The flux of these charged particles is a crucial step for muscle contraction: the change in charge creates an electrical signal called an action potential that spreads through the muscle cell, stimulating the release of calcium that's stored inside it.
This flood of calcium causes the muscle to contract by enabling proteins buried in the muscle fibers to lock together and ratchet towards each other, pulling the muscle tight.
The energy used to power the contraction comes from a molecule called ATP.
ATP also helps pump the ions back across the membrane afterward, resetting the balance of sodium and potassium on either side.
This whole process repeats every time a muscle contracts.
With each contraction, energy in the form of ATP gets used up, waste products like lactic acid are generated, and some ions drift away from the muscle's cell membrane, leaving a smaller and smaller group behind.
Though muscle cells use up ATP as they contract repeatedly, they are always making more, so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still have not depleted this energy source.
And though many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain p H within normal limits, indicating that the tissue is effectively clearing these wastes.
But eventually, over the course of repeated contractions there may not be sufficient concentrations of potassium, sodium or calcium ions immediately available near the muscle cell membrane to reset the system properly.
So even if the brain sends a signal, the muscle cell ca n't generate the action potential necessary to contract.
Even when ions like sodium, potassium or calcium are depleted in or around the muscle cell, these ions are plentiful elsewhere in the body.
With a little time, they will flow back to the areas where they're needed, sometimes with the help of active sodium and potassium pumps.
So if you pause and rest, muscle fatigue will subside as these ions replenish throughout the muscle.
That's because the stronger you are, the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal from the brain to contraction in the muscle has to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight.
Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion, so as your physical fitness improves, you can exercise for longer at the same intensity.
Many muscles grow with exercise, and larger muscles also have bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste, pushing fatigue even farther into the future.
Economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value.
They've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade, like legal systems, corporations, marketplaces.
But there is a new, technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value, and it's called the blockchain.
Now, that's a pretty bold statement, but if you take nothing else away from this talk, I actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new, it's also a continuation of a very human story, and the story is this.
As humans, we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value.
Now, one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the Nobel economist Douglass North.
He passed away at the end of 2015, but North pioneered what's called "new institutional economics."
And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution, and informal constraints, like bribery.
These institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function, and we can see this play out over the course of human history.
If we think back to when we were hunter - gatherer economies, we really just traded within our village structure.
We had some informal constraints in place, but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions.
As our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant, we built up more formal institutions, institutions like banks for currency, governments, corporations.
These institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, and our personal control was much lower.
Eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online.
We built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity.
As Douglass North saw it, institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.
And I believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade, because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone.
So what is the blockchain?
Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer - to - peer network.
It's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what.
The transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured.
This creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network.
This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.
It's not an app.
It's not a company.
I think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia.
We can see everything on Wikipedia.
It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated.
We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia, and we can create our own wikis, because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure.
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time.
On the blockchain, you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets.
It stores the history of custodianship, ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin, other digital assets like a title of ownership of IP.
It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information.
There are of course other technical details to the blockchain, but at it s core, that's how it works.
It's this public registry that stores transactions in a network and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.
Which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways.
So uncertainty is kind of a big term in economics, but I want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions, where blockchains can play a role.
We face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with, not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong.
So let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.
Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay.
The first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from.
Are they a power user?
Do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all?
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks: these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with.
But the problem is they're very fragmented.
Think about how many profiles you have.
Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source.
This allows us to create a user - controlled portable identity.
More than a profile, it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction, for instance that a government issued you an ID, or that you're over 21, by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on.
Having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way.
So I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we're dealing with.
The second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions.
Say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail.
I want some degree of transparency.
I want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there's some record for how it got to me.
This is true not just for electronics like smartphones, but for many kinds of goods and data, things like medicine, luxury goods, any kind of data or product that we do n't want tampered with.
The problem in many companies, especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone, is they're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain.
All of these people that go into making a product, they do n't have the same database.
They do n't use the same infrastructure, and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.
Using the blockchain, we can create a shared reality across nontrusting entities.
By this I mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other, because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves.
Think back to Wikipedia.
It's a shared database, and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time, it has one single truth.
So we can create that using blockchains.
We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority.
So all of these vendors, all sorts of companies, can interact using the same database without trusting one another.
It means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency.
As a real - world object travels along, we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain, adding value as it goes.
This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.
So I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain.
The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open - ended, and it's reneging.
What if you do n't send me the smartphone?
Can I get my money back?
Blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer.
So if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow.
You are financing that phone, but you do n't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met.
You got the phone.
I think this is one of the most exciting ways that blockchains lower our uncertainties, because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement.
It means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated, and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.
I think what would probably floor Douglass North about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work, the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust.
So rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, our governments, our corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.
Now, I do n't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything, even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty, it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rainforest.
The truth is, this technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy.
But there are tons of people working on this, from financial institutions to technology companies, start - ups and universities.
And one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution.
It's also an innovation in computer science.
Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets, even of our own personal attributes, in a totally new way.
So in some ways, they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society, but it does this in a decentralized way.
It does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.
So I think we need to start preparing ourselves, because we are about to face a world where distributed, autonomous institutions have quite a significant role.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.
I think I understood that it's coming, it offers a lot of potential, and it's complex.
What is your estimate for the rate of adoption?
Bettina Warburg: I think that's a really good question.
My lab is pretty much focused on going the enterprise and government route first, because in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.
How many of you actually understand how the internet works?
But you use it every day, so I think we're sort of facing the same John Sculley idea of technology should either be invisible or beautiful, and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now, so it's better suited for either really early adopters who kind of get it and can tinker around or for finding those best use cases like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government.
BG: Thank you.
Thanks for coming to TED.
BW: Thanks.
(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause)
What do these animals have in common?
More than you might think.
Along with over 5,000 other species, they're mammals, or members of class mammalia.
All mammals are vertebrates, meaning they have backbones.
But mammals are distinguished from other vertebrates by a number of shared features.
That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk.
But despite these similarities, these creatures also have many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable is how they give birth.
Let's start with the most familiar, placental mammals.
This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale, the biggest animal on Earth.
Its placenta, a solid disk of blood - rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus to support the developing embryo.
Directly connected to the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste.
Placental mammals can spend far longer inside the womb than other mammals.
Baby blue whales, for instance, spend almost a full year inside their mother.
The placenta keeps the calf alive right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over.
Measuring about 23 feet, a newborn calf is already able to swim.
It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of its mothers thick, fatty milk per day.
Meanwhile, in Australia, you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials.
Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother's pouch.
Take the quoll, one of the world's smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains.
The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single jelly bean - sized baby at a time.
The baby crawls down the middle of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends the next 6 - 11 months suckling.
Even after the baby kangaroo leaves this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk.
Sometimes, she's just one of three babies her mother is caring for.
A female kangaroo can often simultaneously support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch.
When that happens, she's able to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey.
The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce milk from nipples in their pouches, they do n't actually have breasts.
Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably strangest example of mammalian birth.
There were once hundreds of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas and the duck - billed platypus.
The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use for reproduction, excretion, and egg - laying.
Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
Their eggs are soft - shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough to feed themselves.
Despite laying eggs and other adaptations that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck - bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals.
That's because they share the defining characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked to the rest of the class.
Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.
Professor Fukanō, the famous eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop in a plane of his own design.
Able to travel consistently at the incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours to circle the world.
There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey.
Let's be honest.
The professor probably could have designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that?
Instead, he's devised a slightly more elaborate solution: building three identical planes for the mission.
In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them with a few other incredible features.
Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other.
The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri and Orokana will pilot each of the others.
However, only one airport, located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground.
How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out of fuel and crashing?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off by a hair.
The key is to maximize the support each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel.
It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips in either direction while setting the professor up for a long unsupported stretch in the middle.
Here's his solution.
All three planes take off at noon flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.
After 45 minutes, or one - eighth of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left.
Orokana gives 45 to the professor and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both.
With her remaining 45, Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge for a well - deserved break.
45 minutes later, with one - quarter of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri are both at 135 kiloliters again.
Fugōri transfers 45 into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90 he needs to return.
Professor Fukanō stretches and puts on his favorite album.
He'll be alone for a while.
In the meantime, Orokana has been anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go.
As soon as his plane touches the ground, she takes off, this time flying east.
At this point, exactly 180 minutes have passed and the professor is at the halfway point of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.
For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes fly towards each other, meeting at the three - quarter mark.
Just as the professor's fuel is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane.
She gives him 45 kiloliters of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each.
But that's just half of what they need to make it to the airport.
Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri, having refueled, takes off.
45 minutes later, just as the other two planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel to each, leaving 45 for himself.
All three planes land at the airport just as their fuel gauges reach zero.
As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.
I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.
And there are days -- I do n't know about the rest of you -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life.
And some days, that can even be a little scary.
But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open - source collaboration.
A couple of years ago, I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan, in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
Now at the time that I was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment.
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future.
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space.
And that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high - quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
Now to a vegetable plant, my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
But I can offer some natural light and year - round climate control.
Fast - forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food - growing indoors.
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved.
Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate, so a window farm requires a farmer, and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm, and whether she is going to feed her food organically.
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
And I really wanted it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now, and could possibly become another area like Monsanto, where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food.
So I decided that, instead of creating a product, what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers.
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window.
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
But the first few systems were these leaky, loud power - guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved.
(Laughter) So to bring on more codevelopers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us.
So actually now on this website, we have 18,000 people.
And we have window farms all over the world.
What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R &D, or research and development.
But what we call it is R&D - I - Y, or "research and develop it yourself."
(Laughter) So, for example, Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low - light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients.
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project.
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
And with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns, and the universal concerns.
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone.
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
So for do - it - yourselfers, we provide free, very well - tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community.
And to fund the project, we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who do n't have time to build their own systems.
Now within our community, a certain culture has appeared.
In our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy.
What we get out of this project is support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.
But I think that Eleen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration.
So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing.
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
And what we're seeing is that R&D - I - Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems.
And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.
And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united, and to declare that we are all still pioneers.
I'm Denice Frohman, and this is "Accents."
my mom holds her accent like a shotgun, with two good hands.
her tongue, all brass knuckle slipping in between her lips her hips, are all laughter and wind clap.
She speaks a sanchocho of spanish and english, pushing up and against one another, in rapid fire there is no telling my mama to be "quiet," my mama do n't know "quiet."
her voice is one size better fit all and you best not tell her to hush, she waited too many years for her voice to arrive to be told it needed house keeping.
English sits in her mouth remixed so "strawberry" becomes "eh-strawbeddy" and "cookie" becomes "eh-cookie" and kitchen, key chain, and chicken all sound the same.
my mama does n't say "yes" she says, "ah ha" and suddenly the sky in her mouth becomes a Hector Lavoe song.
her tongue ca n't lay itself down flat enough for the English language, it got too much hip too much bone too much conga too much cuatro to two step got too many piano keys in between her teeth, it got too much clave too much hand clap got too much salsa to sit still it be an anxious child wanting to make Play - Doh out of concrete English be too neat for her kind of wonderful.
her words spill in conversation between women whose hands are all they got sometimes our hands are all we got and accents that remind us that we are still bomba, still plena you say "wepa" and a stranger becomes your hermano, you say "dale" and a crowd becomes a family reunion.
my mother's tongue is a telegram from her mother decorated with the coqui's of el campo so even when her lips can barely stretch themselves around english, her accent is a stubborn compass always pointing her towards home.
Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes.
As we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems.
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes, and these creatures define who we are.
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath, or not, and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.
So, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens.
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways.
I get asked all of the time from people, "Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"
And I believe the answer is yes.
I think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously.
I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how, through both conscious and unconscious design, we're impacting these invisible worlds.
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building.
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we sampled dust.
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
This is a picture of Tim, who, right when I snapped this picture, reminded me, he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest, and things have changed dramatically for me."
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices, and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
The way that you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle.
You'll see broad bacterial groups, and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe, it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
If you look inside the restrooms, they all have really similar ecosystems, and if you were to look inside the classrooms, those also have similar ecosystems.
But if you look across these space types, you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another.
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes, it's kind of like being in Costa Rica.
Kind of.
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers, because you can bring on principles of ecology, and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal, the way organisms move around.
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air.
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system.
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right.
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry, but they could also be using biology.
If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building, you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different.
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people, and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people, or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
Given that microbes travel around with people, you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes.
And that is exactly what we found.
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another, they have very similar ecosystems, but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away, the ecosystem is fundamentally different.
And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns, it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems, like hospital - acquired infections.
I believe this has got to be, in part, a building ecology problem.
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
He's an architect, and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building, he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health.
He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated.
So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building.
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation.
A lot of buildings are operated this way, probably where you work, and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before.
Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers.
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well, and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.
He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything.
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone.
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath.
Would n't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible.
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984.
(Video) Big Brother: We are one people with one will, one resolve, one cause.
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail.
Narrator: On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984 wo n't be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
Fast - forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
His app was n't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine, had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users, and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany.
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
So here's the thing.
We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies.
Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed.
Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many, or most, of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question.
So here's the situation.
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation - states.
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace.
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and can not do with our digital lives.
And their sovereignties, cross - cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation - states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and can not do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world.
After all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year.
And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond.
As Wael Ghonim, the Google - Egyptian - executive by day, secret - Facebook - activist by night, famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down, "If you want to liberate a society, just give them the Internet."
But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated.
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles.
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations.
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces.
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May -- not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali.
But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence.
In protest over this, blogger Slim Amamou, who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution, he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem.
In fact, on Twitter, there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said, "Well actually, we do want democracy and free expression, but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off - bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
But the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power?
As Riadh Guerfali, the veteran digital activist from Tunisia, remarked over this incident, "Before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
Today, things are a lot more subtle.
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks.
In fact, in the United States, whatever you may think of Julian Assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime.
So we assume that the Internet is a border - busting technology.
This is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service.
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan, it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling.
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where, effectively, the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government.
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well - known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google + and many of the other overseas websites.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet, known as a system of self - discipline.
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance of their users.
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009 where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top 20 Chinese companies that are best at exercising self - discipline -- i.e. policing their content.
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients.
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site.
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen - centric manner.
Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens, and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives, not to manipulate or enslave us.
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable.
We do n't necessarily always do it very well, but we have a sense of what the models are, politically and institutionally, to do that.
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit?
And government regulation often is n't helping all that much.
You have situations, for instance, in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies, "We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest."
But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous "three- strikes" law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing, which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications, and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior.
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen - centric Internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement.
After all, companies did n't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course, or employing 10 - year - olds as a matter of course, just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do.
It was the result of decades of sustained activism, shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy.
Similarly, governments do n't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day.
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior.
We need to make the same approach with the Internet.
We also are going to need political innovation.
Eight hundred years ago, approximately, the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well, and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation, which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond.
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked.
At the moment, we still do n't know.
But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics, on geopolitics, but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management, investor behavior, consumer choice and even software design and engineering.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around.
(Applause)
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house, I remember these Turkish carpets, and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier.
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
And then there was another influence.
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.
So, I created this compilation of the two: I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there, and some foot straps, and some metal fins, and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
It was really a death trap.
I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
And I realized then I had to go to design school.
(Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there.
(Laughter) So, I went to design school, and it was the early '90s when I finished.
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley, so I wanted to be there, and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes, that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
And they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions.
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"
or "What's this Num Lock key for?"
You know, that thing?
You know, do people really use it?
Do they need it?
Do they want it in their homes? "
(Laughter) What I realized then is, they did n't really want to change the legacy stuff; they did n't want to change the insides.
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins, to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
And I did n't want to be a colorist.
It was n't what I wanted to do.
I did n't want to be a stylist in this way.
And then I saw this quote: "advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
(Laughter) So, I had to start on my own.
So I moved to San Francisco, and I started a little company, fuseproject.
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical.
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow.
And other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need.
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer, and it ships completely flat, and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and what not.
And something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for Swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape.
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
This is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years.
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light.
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.
And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic - type projects.
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value.
And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption.
You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy.
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together.
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology.
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin, and it knows when it is you're talking.
And by knowing when it is you're talking, it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about, which is the environmental noises.
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can.
I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it is n't beautiful, it really does n't belong on your face.
And this is what we're pursuing here.
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
I want to point at something here, on the left.
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work.
But this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs, as the designers on the other side are doing the work.
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
It's really about designing from the inside out.
And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
And it's what I call being design driven.
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.
And then, of course, design is never done.
And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff.
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue to really touch the user, in many ways.
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure.
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership.
We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.
And here's another project, another partnership - type approach.
This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high - sugar - content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.
So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
The bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms.
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask.
So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room: the three - dimensional design, the ideas, the branding, it all becomes deeply connected.
And then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.
Here's another project, which I think really emulates that.
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.
This picture is incredible.
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
I mean, to me, it just means so much.
But when Nicholas Negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas.
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology, and those are pillars of his life, but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
And at the time, I was n't really working on computers.
I did n't really want to, from the previous adventure.
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key -- (Laughter) -- and the Num Lock key, too.
So, I was convinced.
We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi - Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers.
They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea.
And I think this is something really important.
So, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia.
And we went away from obviously the beige.
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there.
So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back.
It was hard.
(Laughter) And it was a prototype.
And a month and a half later, I come back to Switzerland, and there he is playing with his own version.
(Laughter) Like paper, paper and cardboard.
So, I'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play.
(Laughter) Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago.
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
These are the dispensers.
There's this friendly shape.
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does.
And we also designed the condoms themselves.
And I was just in New York at the launch, and I went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a Puerto Rican little mom - and - pop store; at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.
And here's the public service announcement for this project.
(Music) (Laughter) Get some.
(Applause) So, this is really where design is able to create a conversation.
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them.
They were excited.
It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do.
So, I was going to throw some condoms in the room and what not, but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
(Laughter) Yeah? All right, all right.
I have only a few.
(Laughter) (Applause) So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
(Laughter) And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.
(Laughter) So, I'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, I think we can change the work that we do.
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
So, thank you.
What if you could only see one color?
Imagine, for instance, that you could only see things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you.
As it turns out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light.
Different kinds of light are all around you everyday but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs, to the x - rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food.
In order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about what light is.
Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a particle.
Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean.
There are big waves and small waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll in every so often.
The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by is called its frequency.
Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by.
If the waves that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency.
If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob up and down much more often, at a high frequency.
Different kinds of light are all waves, they just have different wavelengths and frequencies.
If you know the wavelength or frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out it s energy.
Long wavelengths have low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies.
It's easy to remember if you think about being in that boat.
If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves, you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling over.
But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy.
The energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our eyes.
When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina.
Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light.
Inside our retina are special receptors called rods and cones.
The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is.
The cones are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to different energies of light.
Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high - energy light.
When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our brain to perceive colors.
The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of its energy.
At one side of the rainbow is low - energy light we see as red, and at the other side is high - energy light we see as blue.
If light shines on us that has an energy our retina ca n't measure, we wo n't be able to see it.
Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength does n't have enough energy to stimulate our retina at all.
The only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wavelength.
Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x - rays have short wavelengths.
And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in between.
Even though our eyes ca n't detect light outside of the visible range, we can build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of like digital eyes.
With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though we ca n't see it ourselves.
Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your microwave.
Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday life, but here's something even more amazing.
When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum.
If we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light, it would be like having only one crayon -- pretty sad.
To see the universe in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light.
You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light.
But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each see part of the full spectrum of light.
With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see some amazing things.
And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth.
So, since we know the physics of how x - ray, ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too.
So, as you go about your daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and ca n't see.
Knowing just a little bit about the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the time.
Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism.
However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long - term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.
The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity.
In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.
In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation.
And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.
Economic growth matters.
With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
The context matters.
And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth.
You worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world.
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today?
Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts.
Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods.
But nevertheless, this framework -- this two - stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
First of all, we can draw on the right - wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
In particular, right - leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left - leaning policies.
Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China.
But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction.
Of course, left - leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the 19th - century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public - private partnerships.
More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
My fundamental message to you is this: We can not continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
In order to create sustainable, long - term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad - minded about what might work.
Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
What do you say to those who react that way?
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion.
There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards.
And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.
BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
Do you see that happening?
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.
However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes.
And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
Is that what you're suggesting?
DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open - minded.
I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance.
The second largest economy is China.
It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.
I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we do n't know.
BG: One last question.
The COP21 is going on in Paris.
If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?
DM: Again, I would be very much about being open - minded.
As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want.
Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we do n't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&D.
And so they have to come to the table as well.
But in essence, it can not be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.
Statistics are persuasive.
So much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base some of their most important decisions on organized data.
But there's a problem with that.
Any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it, something that can turn the results completely upside down.
For example, imagine you need to choose between two hospitals for an elderly relative's surgery.
Out of each hospital's last 1000 patient's, 900 survived at Hospital A, while only 800 survived at Hospital B.
So it looks like Hospital A is the better choice.
But before you make your decision, remember that not all patients arrive at the hospital with the same level of health.
And if we divide each hospital's last 1000 patients into those who arrived in good health and those who arrived in poor health, the picture starts to look very different.
Hospital A had only 100 patients who arrived in poor health, of which 30 survived.
But Hospital B had 400, and they were able to save 210.
So Hospital B is the better choice for patients who arrive at hospital in poor health, with a survival rate of 52.5%.
And what if your relative's health is good when she arrives at the hospital?
Strangely enough, Hospital B is still the better choice, with a survival rate of over 98%.
So how can Hospital A have a better overall survival rate if Hospital B has better survival rates for patients in each of the two groups?
What we've stumbled upon is a case of Simpson's paradox, where the same set of data can appear to show opposite trends depending on how it's grouped.
This often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable, sometimes known as a lurking variable, which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influences results.
Here, the hidden factor is the relative proportion of patients who arrive in good or poor health.
Simpson's paradox is n't just a hypothetical scenario.
It pops up from time to time in the real world, sometimes in important contexts.
One study in the UK appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than nonsmokers over a twenty - year time period.
That is, until dividing the participants by age group showed that the nonsmokers were significantly older on average, and thus, more likely to die during the trial period, precisely because they were living longer in general.
Here, the age groups are the lurking variable, and are vital to correctly interpret the data.
In another example, an analysis of Florida's death penalty cases seemed to reveal no racial disparity in sentencing between black and white defendants convicted of murder.
But dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different story.
In either situation, black defendants were more likely to be sentenced to death.
The slightly higher overall sentencing rate for white defendants was due to the fact that cases with white victims were more likely to elicit a death sentence than cases where the victim was black, and most murders occurred between people of the same race.
So how do we avoid falling for the paradox?
Unfortunately, there's no one - size - fits - all answer.
Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary categories.
All we can do is carefully study the actual situations the statistics describe and consider whether lurking variables may be present.
Otherwise, we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own agendas.
It's a diagram of the visual system.
And some things look very familiar today.
Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.
There's a very large nose that does n't seem to be connected to anything in particular.
And if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system, you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years.
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain, rather than just looking at its overall shape.
Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
You really would be kind of out of luck.
You want to be able to open it up, crack it open, look at the wiring inside.
And up until a little more than a century ago, nobody was able to do that with the brain.
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there.
It's gray, formless.
There's no structure.
It wo n't tell you anything.
And this all changed in the late 19th century.
Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.
The computer was cracked open.
So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain.
And it works in a very particular way.
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience, applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this, and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.
And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer, this is the transistor.
And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons do n't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer.
Today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons, they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.
And there's several ways of doing this.
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein.
Now green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful.
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors.
And so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
And it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell.
And there's several ways of doing this, but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies.
And you're familiar, of course, with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.
But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, like, for example, the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body.
And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually.
And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful, but they're also very powerful.
They have great explanatory power.
This, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
And you've heard of serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.
You've heard of SSRIs, which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.
And in order to understand how serotonin works, it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.
And antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question.
I'd like to leave you with the following thought: Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get - go.
They were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason, or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, "Hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette."
And instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch, there were these ready - made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all.
I was raised in Seoul, Korea, and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism.
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
And the way to it, for me, was through artistic means.
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society.
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives, they're also considered pests.
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two, and a man came up to me and said, "You ca n't take photographs here.
The MTA will confiscate your camera. "
I'll follow the rats. "
Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people do n't get to see.
Around the same time, I met like - minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers, guerrilla historians, etc.
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet - based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
When I took photographs in these locations, I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
Simply documenting these soon - to - be - demolished structures was n't enough for me.
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself.
I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time - specific elements.
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
It's now an empty, six - acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned.
When I first went in, I was scared, because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
But they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
When I got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again.
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
It lasted about five years.
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
When you go into spaces like this, you're directly accessing the past, because they sit untouched for decades.
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home, you're actually feeling the hand - laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
There's nobody around you, and you hear the kids playing in the park above you, completely unaware of what's underneath.
When I was going out a lot to these places, I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life, and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen," which references Charles Baudelaire.
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York, and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
This is the same tunnel.
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching.
This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
I was there alone, setting up, and a homeless man approached.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
I was really frightened at first, but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he did n't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self - timer and ran back and forth.
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out.
It must have been a very unusual day for him.
(Laughter) One thing that struck me, after this incident, was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
That homeless man, to me, really represented an element of the unconscious of the city.
He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island, and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This is the New York City Farm Colony, which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
This children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in Newark.
When I was there three years ago, the windows were broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there as it was.
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x - ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table.
After exploring recently - abandoned buildings, I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast: your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church -- any man - made structures around you.
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are.
I love to travel, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
It's full of history, and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war.
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
I saw the structure while I was on the train, and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb - like basement, which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.
I explored there extensively in the off - limits areas and fell in love right away.
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels, and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century, the caving - in of some of these quarries posed safety threats, so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place.
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.
The remains of over six million people are housed in there, some over 1,300 years old.
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located.
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the World War II era.
This is a German bunker.
Nearby there's a French bunker, and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance, which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris.
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
It was built in the early 1500s.
I do n't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
It was not very comfortable.
(Laughter) And all this time, I never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when I was in the London sewers.
This was probably the toughest place to explore.
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture.
And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
And this is the first theater project I worked on.
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn, which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world, built in 1844.
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way -- before they're lost forever.
(Guitar music starts) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Music ends)
For as far back as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated with death and resurrection.
Nearly every religion in the world has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters, the dead keep coming back.
But is resurrection really possible?
